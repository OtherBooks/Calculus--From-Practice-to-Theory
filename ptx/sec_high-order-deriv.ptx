  <title>Higher Order Derivatives: Derivatives of Derivatives</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that if, for example, <m>y=x^3,</m> then <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = 3x^2.</m>
    If we differentiate the expression <m>3x^2</m> we get <m>6x,</m>
    but what should we call <m>6x</m> as it relates to <m>y?</m> Since we got <m>6x</m>
    by differentiating <m>y=x^3</m> twice the obvious choice is to call <m>6x</m>
    the <em>second derivative</em> of <m>y=x^3.</m> Clearly then <m>3x^2</m> is the
    <em>first derivative</em> and <m>6</m> the <em>third derivative</em> of
    <m>y=x^3.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    All well and good, but what <em>notation</em> should we use when
    writing these things?
  </p>

  <p>
    For better or worse the notation that has been invented and become
    standard is this:
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{ If }  y \amp = x^3 \text{ then }</mrow>
      <mrow>\dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{}{x}(y) \amp = 3x^2 \text{ as before, and }</mrow>
      <mrow>\dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)=\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} \amp = 6x. \text{ 
                                                             Notice the
                                                             placement of
                                                             the exponents. }</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    Differentiating one more time we get
    <me>
      \dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}\right)=\dfdxn{y}{x}{3} = 6.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once more and we get <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{4} = 0.</m> Obviously we can continue
    this process as many times as we would like, although for this
    particular example since the fourth derivative and every derivative
    thereafter is zero this would be rather dull. The following example is
    more interesting.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the expression <m>y=\sin(x).</m> As we've seen <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=
          \cos(x).</m> Continuing we have <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = -\sin(x),</m>
        <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{3} = -\cos(x),</m> and finally <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{4} =
          \sin(x).</m> Thereafter the pattern of derivatives clearly repeats.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>(a)</title>
          <p>
            Compute <m>\dfdxn{}{x}{34}\left(\sin(x)\right),</m>   <m>\dfdxn{}{x}{17}\left(\sin(x)\right),</m> <m>\dfdxn{}{x}{1999}\left(\sin(x)\right),</m> and
                <m>\dfdxn{}{x}{103}\left(\sin(x)\right).</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>(b)</title>
          <p>
            Repeat part (a), but using the <m>\cos(x).</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    We would be remiss if we did not point out some very
    troubling aspects of this notation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider, when we introduced the concept of a differential in <xref ref="chapt_differentials">Chapter</xref> we appealed to your understanding of
    <em>finite</em> differences. That is, if <m>x_1\lt x_2</m> then the finite
    difference
    <me>
      \Delta{}x=x_2-x_1
    </me>
    is a measure of the actual separation between <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1.</m>
    Extending this to differential, if we imagine that <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1</m> are
    <em>infinitely</em> close together <mdash /> but still distinct <mdash /> then we
    represented the distance between them as
    <me>
      \d x = x_2-x_1.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    It is all well and good to <em>write</em> expressions like <m>\d x</m> or
    <m>\d y</m> but what does <m>\d x</m> represent, really?
  </p>

  <p>
    If <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1</m> are infinitely close together doesn't that mean that
    they are <em>not</em> separated at all? If they are not separated
    then <m>x_2=x_1.</m> In that case isn't <m>\d x =x_2-x_1</m> just zero? And if
    <m>\d x =0</m> then isn't the expression <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> dividing by zero,
    which we know is meaningless?
  </p>

  <p>
    Now consider the meaning of the <em>second</em> derivative. If the
    first derivative is obtained by computing the ratio of quantities that
    are infinitely close together, what can it possibly mean to
    differentiate it again? If we've already taken numbers that are
    infinitesimally close together to compute the first derivative, what
    can we possibly be using to compute the second, or the third
    derivative?
  </p>

  <p>
    What is the infinitesimal difference (<m>\d^2 x</m>) of an infinitesimal
    difference (<m>\d x)?</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is all very puzzling and it is tempting to toss it all away,
    except that we have a great deal of confidence that
    <m>\dfdx{\left(x^3\right)}{x}=3x^2,</m> and that
    <m>\dfdx{\left(3x^2\right)}{x}=6x.</m> We've seen both of these used in the
    last section to compute the roots of polynomials correctly. There must
    be something to this, but it is extremely hard to tell at this
    point what it is.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we are honest with ourselves we must acknowledge these
    questions. There is something here that we do not understand. We
    would like to understand it, but we do not yet. We will proceed for
    now, but very cautiously.

    {{ Foreshadowing: An Extension of the Tangent Line Idea}}
    When <m>\frac{-\pi}{2}\le x\le\frac{\pi}{2}</m> a well known approximation
    of <m>\cos(x)</m> is
    <me>
      \cos(x)\approx 1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    An obvious question is, <q>How do we obtain this approximation?</q> That
    is, when you compare the graphs it is clear that this polynomial stays
    close to <m>\cos(x)</m> for small values of <m>x,</m> but how would anyone come
    up with it in the first place?
  </p>

  <p>
    This is actually a straightforward consequence of the
    construction of tangent lines using the derivative.
  </p>

  <p>
    We begin by constructing the tangent line of this graph at the point
    <m>(0,1).</m> This is not hard. If
    <m>y=\cos(x)</m> then <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=0}=0.</m> Therefore an equation of the
    tangent line at <m>(0,1)</m> is
    <me>
      y=\underbrace{\left[\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=0}\right]}_{=0}(x-0) +1
    </me>
    or
    <me>
      y=1.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Most likely you knew that already.
    From following figure
  </p>

  <p>
    <image width="37%" source="images/CosApprox.png" />
    we see that at the point of tangency the graphs of <m>y=\cos(x)</m> and
    <m>y=1</m> share two interesting features:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Both pass through the point <m>(0,1)</m> and
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Both have a slope of zero at that point.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    That is, when <m>x=0</m> the slope of <m>\cos(x)</m> is the same as the slope of
    our tangent line. Indeed, this is fairly obvious. That's what a
    tangent line is. But suppose we could find a function whose first
    <em>and second</em> derivatives match <m>\cos(x)</m> at <m>x=0?</m> What would
    that look like?
  </p>

  <p>
    That function is <m>y=1-\frac{x^2}{2}</m> and it looks like this:
    \InsertGraphic
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see where this is going, right? The curve <m>y=
    1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}</m> is the polynomial with the property
    that its first four derivatives at <m>x=0</m> match the first four
    derivatives of <m>\cos(x),</m> also at <m>x=0.</m>

    This completes the introductory portion of a first course
    in Calculus. At this point we have derived all of the differentiation
    rules you will need to differentiate a very large class of functions.
