  <title>The Differential: Geometry and Dynamics</title>
  <p>
    Historically, Calculus has been viewed in two fundamentally different
    ways. Leibniz's approach was built on the classical methods of
    geometry, and Newton used a dynamical, physical approach. As a
    mindset<fn>A mindset is just a <q>way of thinking</q> about
      something. For example, many people have the mindset that <q>Math is
      hard because it is just a horrible gobbledy-gook of stupid symbols
      that don't mean anything.  I will never understand it.</q> Such a
      mindset prevents many otherwise very capable people from
      understanding even the simplest mathematics.''  Aren't you glad
      you're not making that particular mistake?</fn>neither approach is
    either correct or incorrect. They are simply two different ways to
    come at the same idea. However some problems are easier to think about
    geometrically and some are easier to think about dynamically so it
    will be useful to be familiar with both mindsets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since most people have a good intuitive feel for how moving objects
    behave we will start by adopting Newton's kinematic
    viewpoint. However, this will immediately cause a problem since the
    notation used by Leibniz has become standard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leibniz thought long and hard about inventing a notation that
    reflected his ideas and it is his notation that was eventually
    adopted. Thus we have this fundamental tension when we learn
    Calculus. We begin with Newton's kinematic approach fused with
    Leibniz's geometric notation.

    Consider a point starting at the origin and moving in a straight line
    along the <m>x</m> axis so that its position at time <m>t</m> is given by
    <m>x(t).</m> We take the differential <m>\d{t}</m> to mean the <q>next instant</q>
    of time<fn>Please do not think too much about the meaning of the
      phrase <q>in the next instant of time.</q> You will go mad. We will
      return to this later.</fn>and the differential <m>\d{x}</m> to be the
    position of our point also in the <q>next instant</q> of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    \begin{mynotation}{Leibniz's Differential vs. Newton's Dot}
    Leibniz would say that the differentials <m>\d{x}</m> and <m>\d{t}</m> are
    fixed geometric quantities and that their ratio, <m>\dfdx{x}{t},</m> is
    an (infinitesimal) distance divided by an (infinitesimal) time, so
    it is represents the velocity with which our point is moving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Newton would say that at any given moment the moving point has some
    velocity which he denoted <m>\dot{x}.</m> Clearly then
    <m>\dfdx{x}{t}=\dot{x}.</m> Just as clearly the mindsets behind these two
    notational schemes are at odds with each other. The Leibniz, or
    differential, notation is static. That is, <m>\d{x}</m> and <m>\d{t}</m> are
    fixed quantities whose ratio is clearly meant to reflect the idea
    that the velocity of the point can be computed via the fraction
    <m>\frac{\text{ distance } }{\text{ time } }.</m> On the other hand Newton's
    dot notation takes velocity itself as a basic quantity not to be
    computed from simpler concepts, and so it is about motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, there is nothing either inherently right, or inherently
    wrong, with either notation. The two notations simply reflect
    different mindsets <mdash /> point of view <mdash /> that can be adopted as
    needed.
  </p>

      <p>
        The quantity denoted by either <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m> or <m>\dot{x}</m> is
        called the derivative<fn>Newton's dot notation is still
            used by physicists in the special case where motion is
            involved. That is, <m>\dot{x}</m> is used specifically to represent the
            change of position with respect to time, ie., velocity.

            Sadly, it is the only notation invented by Newton which is still
            in common use. Four hundred years later, Leibniz's much more
            carefully designed differential notation has become universal.</fn>of <m>x</m> with respect to <m>t.</m> When <m>x</m> depends on only one other
        variable this is often shortened to <q>the derivative of <m>x</m></q>
        since there is no ambiguity. But eventually we will be dealing with
        situations where <m>x</m> might depend on two or more other variables so
        keep in mind that the variable <m>t</m> is an essential part of the
        derivative.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    One of the difficulties with learning Calculus is the abundance of
    different notations available for basic concepts like the
    derivative<fn>These are only two of them. There are
        others.</fn>. This can be a little overwhelming at first so to keep
    things simple we will be using the differential notation,
    <m>\dfdx{x}{t},</m> exclusively at first. This will cause a certain
    awkwardness in some situations. For example, using Newton's dot
    notation if we want to refer to the velocity of our point <m>5</m>
    seconds after starting our clock we would simply write <m>\dot{x}(5)</m>
    as usual. Using the differential notation we will adopt the
    convention that the velocity at <m>5</m> seconds is written thus:
    <me>
      \left.\dfdx{x}{t}\right|_{t=5}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    This probably seems unnecessarily cumbersome to you but be assured we
    have not made this choice lightly, and this notation, while it is a
    bit cumbersome, has certain advantages that will become apparent
    later.
