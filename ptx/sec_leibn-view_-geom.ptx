  <p>
    Newton's dynamical view of the Calculus is very useful. However it is
    only one way to approach the topic. Leibniz had an entirely different
    approach. In Leibniz's view every point on the graph at the right is
    already in place so the graph can be thought of as a completed
    entity. It is not <q>brought into being</q> by the motion of a point, a
    pixel, or anything else. If we want to know the shape of this graph
    . . . well, that's easy isn't it? Just look at it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course that only works if we have a picture of the graph in hand,
    or if we can generate one easily. But suppose we hadn't shown you the
    above graph. Suppose instead we'd asked you to describe the graph of:
    <me>
      y=-\frac15(4x^3-16x^2+11x-9).
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok. Sure. Since you're living after the invention of computing
    technology you'd have just pulled some electronic device out of your
    pocket, opened your favorite graphing app, punched in the formula
    above, held it out to us and said, <q>Here it is.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Touch&#xea; You got us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Obviously though, neither Newton nor Leibniz could have done that, but
    so what? We can, so we're done, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well maybe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose now that we'd said there is curve whose derivative
    is
    <me>
      \dfdx{y}{x}=-\frac{12}{5}x^2 +\frac{32}{5}x-\frac{11}{5},
    </me>
    and asked, <q>What is its shape?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is harder, but Leibiz's differential notation is extremely
    well-suited to express his approach. The expression <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>
    clearly expresses the idea that the deriviative is the slope of the
    tangent to<fn>Leibniz would have said <q>tangent of</q> rather
    than <q>tangent to.</q> In his view he was computing the slope of the
    curve itself.</fn>the curve <m>y</m> at the point <m>.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    We know a lot about lines. For example we know that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the slope of a line is positive then the <m>y</m> coordinate is
            increasing.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If the slope is negative then the <m>y</m> coordinate is decreasing.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If the slope is zero then the <m>y</m> coordinate is not changing.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, lines are easy because the slope of a line never
    changes. But we're interested in curves. The slope of a curve changes
    from point to point so how does this list help us?
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where Leibniz's conception of the derivative as a ratio of
    differentials is helpful. Since <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}</m> is the slope of
    the function at the point <m>x=a</m> it is clear that the above list of
    statements generalizes as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          At every point <m>x=a</m> where <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}>0</m>  the curve is
            increasing. (Notice that we can only claim that the curve is
            increasing at the single point <m>x=a.</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          At every point <m>x=a</m> where <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}\lt 0</m>  the curve is
            decreasing. (Notice that we can only claim that the curve is
            decreasing at the single point <m>x=a.</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          At every point <m>x=a</m> where <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}=0</m>  the curve is
            horizontal.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Regarding item 3) above, if
    <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}=0</m> then clearly near <m>x=a</m> the graph of <m>y</m> has
    one of the two shapes at the right, which confirms that we can find
    the maximum height of a tossed by by setting
    <me>
      v(t) = \dfdx{p}{t} =0
    </me>
    and solving for <m>t.</m> This is only common sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately our common sense fails us here. It is, in fact,
    <em>not</em> true that if
    <me>
      \dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}=0
    </me>
    then <m>y</m> is either a maximum or a minimum at <m>x=a</m> as the following
    problem demonstrates.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the polynomial
        <me>
          y = (x+1)^3(x-1)(x+3).
        </me>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>(a)</title>
            <p>
              Show that <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=-1}=0.</m> (Hint: You can save
                yourself a lot of work on this problem by keeping you eye on the
                goal. You are not asked to compute <m>\dfdx{y}{x}.</m> The problem is to
                show that <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=-1}=0.</m> You don't need to
                fully expand <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> to do that.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(b)</title>
            <p>
              Graph <m>y</m> near <m>x=1</m> to convince yourself that <m>y</m> is
                neither a maximum nor a minimum at <m>x=-1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(c)</title>
            <p>
              We don't really need a polynomial as complicated as the one
                given in part (a) to make the point we're getting at. Repeat parts
                (a) and (b) with the polynomial <m>y=x^3</m> at <m>x=0.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    It is important to notice, as we did above, that when we are dealing
    with curves rather than lines we can only state that the curve is
    increasing at the single point where the derivative is positive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compare this with the ease of finding the equation of the tangent
    line to <m>y=x^3</m> in the problem above using Calculus: We have <m>y=x^3</m>
    from which we have <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = 3x^2.</m> So the slope of the tangent
    line at <m>(3,9)</m> is <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=3} = 3(3)^2=27.</m> Thus
    the equation of the line tangent to <m>y=x^3</m> at the point <m>(3,9)</m> is
    <me>
      y-9=27(x-3). \text{ (Tada!) }
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    It is easy to see how the methods of Calculus replaced previous
    efforts.
