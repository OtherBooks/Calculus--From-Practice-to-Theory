  <title>Representation of Numbers</title>
  <p>
    The decimal place-value representation of a number like <m>43527</m> is so
    familiar that it feels easy and natural, even simple. It is anything
    but. Our familiar base ten number representation notation is actually
    extremely sophisticated. It only seems simple because we learn it in
    childhood and use it every day for all of our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example the notation <m>"43527"</m> is actually a condensed form of
    <me>
      4\cdot10^4+3\cdot10^3+5\cdot10^2+2\cdot10^1+7\cdot10^0,
    </me>
    but numbers written in this form are very difficult to work with. We
    get our usual representation <m>"43527"</m> by observing that the powers of
    ten needn't be explicitly written down since they are clearly
    indicated by the position of each digit. Hence the name <q>place
    value.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    However, once the place value system is adopted we do lose
    some flexibility, since the digits must appear in the proper
    order. For example <m>"72534"</m> is a completely different number than
    <m>"43527,"</m> but
    <me>
      4\cdot10^4+3\cdot10^3+5\cdot10^2+2\cdot10^1+7\cdot10^0
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      7\cdot10^0+2\cdot10^1+5\cdot10^2+3\cdot10^3+4\cdot10^4
    </me>
    are the same. It will be convenient for us to use this last ordering
    soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    As long as our base is <m>10</m> the place value notation prevents us
    from confusing the number <m>"43527"</m> with, say, <m>"18263."</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    But suppose our base is <m>8.</m> The then number
    <me>
      43527 = 4\cdot8^4+3\cdot8^3+5\cdot8^2+2\cdot8^1+7\cdot8^0 = 18263.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly we can't allow this kind of ambiguity. We can't allow the same
    set of digits, written in the same order, to mean both <q>forty-three
    thousand five hundred twenty-nine,</q> <em>and</em> <q>eighteen
    thousand two hundred sixty three,</q> <em>and</em> <q>sixty-three
    thousand one hundred ninety-one,</q> which is what we would get if we
    interpreted the digits <m>"43527"</m> using <q>11</q> as the base. To prevent
    this sort of confusion we will use subscripts. That is,
    <me>
      43527_{10} = 4\cdot10^4+3\cdot10^3+5\cdot10^2+2\cdot10^1+7\cdot10^0
    </me>
    whereas
    <me>
      43527_{8} = 4\cdot8^4+3\cdot8^3+5\cdot8^2+2\cdot8^1+7\cdot8^0 = 18263_{10},
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      43527_{11} = 4\cdot11^4+3\cdot11^3+5\cdot11^2+2\cdot11^1+7\cdot11^0 = 63191_{10}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Naturally as long as we only use base 10 notation there is no
    ambiguity. Since this is the usual situation we usually suppress the
    subscripts.
  </p>

  <p>
    But sometimes it is necessary to use a base other than <m>10</m> and it is
    necessary to convert from one base to another. This conversion can be
    difficult at first, mainly because it is unfamiliar. That is, in base
    <m>10</m> the number one hundred twenty-one is written <m>121_{10}</m> but in
    base <m>5</m> it is <m>441_5.</m>
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Verify that <m>121_{10} = 441_5.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    If we did not know the base <m>5</m> representation how could we find it?
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds harder than it is. If we write
    <me>
      121_{10} = a_0 +a_1\cdot5 + a_2\cdot5^2
    </me>
    we can find the unknown coefficients in the
    order given as follows. Divide each side of the above equation by <m>5.</m>
    On the right we get
    <me>
      a_1+a_2\cdot5, \text{ with a remainder of \(a_0\). }
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    On the left we get <m>\frac{121}{5} = 24</m> with a remainder of <m>1.</m> So
    <m>a_0 = 1</m> and
    <me>
      24 = a_1+a_2\cdot5.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Dividing both sides of this last formula by <m>5</m> again gives a
    remainder of <m>a_1</m> on the right and of <m>4</m> on the left, and <m>a_2=4</m> as
    well. Therefore
    <me>
      121_{10} = 441_5.
    </me>
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Convert <m>121_{10}</m> to each of the following bases.
        <ul>
          <li>

            <p>
              <m>3</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(b)</title>
            <p>
              <m>4</m>
            </p>

            <title>(c)</title>
            <p>
              <m>8</m>
