      { A Problem to Think About:
      }
      Previously (p. XX) we showed that the catenary (hanging chain)
      <m>y=y(x)</m> satisfied the equation
      <me>
        \dfdx{y}{x}{2}=\frac{w}{H} \sqrt{1+  \left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)^2 }
      </me>
      where <m>w</m> is the weight density of the chain, and <m>H</m> is the constant
      (magnitude of the) horizontal tension. We also showed that a parabola
      does not satisfy this equation. In this chapter we will look at
      functions which help us to determine the solution.
