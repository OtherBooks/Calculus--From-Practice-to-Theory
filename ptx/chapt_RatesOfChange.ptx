  <title>Motion, Rates of Change, Tangent Lines</title>

      It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Calculus was the
      invention (discovery?) of two men, Isaac Newton <m>(1643-1727)</m> and
      Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz <m>(1646-1716).</m> Newton developed his
      ideas at his home of Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire while Cambridge
      University was closed by a plague in the summer of <m>1665.</m> In a period
      of less than two years he made the extraordinary advances while still
      under the age of <m>25.</m> Independently Leibniz developed his ideas
      during the period 1673-1675 while serving as a diplomat in Paris. He
      wrote the first paper<fn>The rather cumbersome title of Leibniz
        <m>1684</m> paper: <em>A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as
          Tangents, Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational
          Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This,</em> is very
        revealing.  Clearly, the problem of optimizing (finding maxima and
        minima) is of central importance and somehow finding tangent lines
        to curves is involved.  That this is a <em><em>new</em></em> method
        means that other methods were available first.</fn>about calculus in

      As with most scientific discoveries, although they are given credit,
      it is a mistake to believe that these two men worked in isolation.
      Indeed, Newton is frequently quoted as saying, <q>If I have seen
      further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants,</q>
      and, Leibniz remarks in his paper that <q>Other very learned men have
      sought in many devious ways what someone versed in this calculus can
      accomplish in these lines as by magic.</q>
