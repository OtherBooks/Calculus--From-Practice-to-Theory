  <title>The Definition of the Derivative</title>
  <p>
    { A Problem to Think About:
    }
    Functions are more complicated entities than we might suppose at
    first. We have alluded to the fact that some functions do not have
    derivatives, but the reality is much more subtle and interesting
    than we might suppose at first. Some functions have derivatives
    everywhere in their domain except at a single point. Some at multiple
    points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some do not have derivatives anywhere and yet are continuous
    everywhere. Very strange.

    Unfortunately this is not the place to investigate all of this in
    depth, but we will consider the following: Each of the following
    functions is differentiable everywhere, except possibly at <m>x=0.</m> Can
    you tell which is, and which is not differentiable at <m>x=0?</m>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) =
            \begin{cases}x^{\frac13}\sin\left(\frac1x\right)\amp  x\neq0\\
              0                                \amp  x=0
          \end{cases}</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) =
            \begin{cases}x\sin\left(\frac1x\right)\amp  x\neq0\\
              0                                \amp  x=0
          \end{cases}</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) =
            \begin{cases}x^{\frac23}\sin\left(\frac1x\right)\amp  x\neq0\\
              0                                \amp  x=0
          \end{cases}</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) =
            \begin{cases}x^2\sin\left(\frac1x\right)\amp  x\neq0\\
              0                                \amp  x=0
          \end{cases}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
