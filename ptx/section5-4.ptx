        <p>
          Consider the top view of an airplane <m>P</m> starting at the point
          <m>(1,0)</m> and traveling up the line <m>x=1</m> at a constant speed <m>v.</m>
          When the plane is at <m>(1,0),</m> a homing missile <m>M</m> is fired from
          the origin directly at the plane. Assuming that the missile
          travels at a speed which is <m>k</m> times the speed of the plane
          <m>(k>1)</m> and is always aimed directly at the plane, find the path
          the missile takes. [Such a path is called a pursuit curve.] The

    <title>Rainbows</title>
    <p>
      Did you ever notice a double rainbow?
      \InsertGraphic
      Look carefully at the order of the colors in the primary rainbow and
      the secondary rainbow. Do you notice that it is reversed? Why does
      this happen? There are some other questions which readily come to
      mind. Why is the primary rainbow below the secondary one? Why is the
      primary rainbow brighter and why isn't there always a secondary
      rainbow? We will use what we know about the refraction and reflection
      of light to examine some of these questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a ray of light enters a raindrop (which is spherical), it gets
      both refracted and reflected.
      <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow1.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see in the diagram, the ray of light entering the raindrop
      at an angle of radian measure <m>\alpha</m> is refracted to an angle of radian
      measure <m>\beta.</m> This is governed by Snell's Law <m>\sin\alpha/v_a =\sin\beta/v_b,</m>
      where <m>v_a</m> and <m>v_b</m> are the velocities of light in air and water,
      respectively. Actually only a portion is refracted as the other
      portion is reflected off the exterior of the raindrop. Once inside
      the raindrop, it reflects off of the back of the raindrop (again only
      a portion) so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of
      reflection. A portion of the light then exits the raindrop governed
      by Snell's Law again. The total amount of (clockwise) rotation in
      this process is called the deviation angle <m>D(\alpha).</m>
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>D(\alpha)=\pi-2(2\beta-\alpha)=\pi-4\beta+2\alpha.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice that <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are not independent, they are governed by Snell's Law which we will rewrite as
          <me>
            \sin\alpha=v_a/v_b\sin\beta=k \sin\beta
          </me>
          where <m>k=v_a/v_b</m> is the index of refraction (for water). In the case of white light, this index of refraction is about <m>4/3.</m> Graphing <m>D(\alpha)</m> for this value of <m>k</m> and <m>0\le\alpha\le \pi/2,</m> we have
          <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow2.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice from the graph that the minimum of this curve appears to be
          around the point <m>(1.03,2.41).</m> This says that the minimum value of
          <m>D(\alpha)</m> is about <m>2.41 radians\approx 138^\circ</m> and it occurs when <m>\alpha\approx 1.03
          radians\approx 59.4^\circ.</m> Notice from an enlargement the graph near that minimum
          that for values of <m>\alpha</m> near <m>1.03</m> the amount of deviation is roughly the
          same.
          <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow3.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          This says that light rays entering the raindrop at approximately
          <m>59\circ</m> have the highest concentration when exiting the raindrop.
          At other values of <m>\alpha</m> the dispersion of light is greater. This
          provides the angle that the rainbow makes with an observer. This
          supplementary angle to <m>D(\alpha)</m> is called the rainbow angle,
          <me>
            R(\alpha)=\pi-D(\alpha)  radians=180^\circ-(180^\circ)/\pi D(\alpha).
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow4.png" />
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that for an index of refraction <m>k</m> that <m>D(\alpha)</m> is minimized when
          <m>\sin\alpha=\sqrt{(4-k^2)/3}.</m> Use this to fill in the following table:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
                \hline{}
                Color\amp k\amp \alpha in degrees\amp R(\alpha) in degrees\\\hline
                 \text{ Red } \amp 1.331\amp \amp \\\hline
                Orange\amp 1.332\amp \amp \\\hline
                Yellow\amp 1.333\amp \amp \\\hline
                Green\amp 1.335\amp \amp \\\hline
                Blue\amp 1.337\amp \amp \\\hline
                Indigo\amp 1.340\amp \amp \\\hline
                Violet\amp 1.344\amp \amp \\\hline
            \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The values of <m>R(\alpha)</m> you obtained in the table accounts for the
      various color bands that appear in the rainbow as sunlight hits
      droplets at various angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow5.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary rainbow is created by light entering the upper portion of
      the raindrop. If light is bright enough then a secondary rainbow is
      created from light entering the lower portion of the raindrop as in
      the diagram below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/Rainbow6.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This time the deviation angle <m>D(\alpha)</m> is the total amount of clockwise
      rotation and the rainbow angle would be <m>R(\alpha)=D(\alpha)-\pi.</m> Note that the
      extra reflection accounts for the rainbow being not as bright.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that in the case of the secondary rainbow
          <me>
            D(\alpha)=2\alpha-6\beta+2\pi.
          </me>
          and show that this is minimized when <m>\cos\alpha\sqrt{(k^2-1)/8.}</m> Use
          this to complete the following table.
          <me>
            \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
                \hline{}
                Color\amp k\amp \alpha in degrees\amp R(\alpha) in degrees\\\hline
                 \text{ Red } \amp 1.331\amp \amp \\\hline
                Orange\amp 1.332\amp \amp \\\hline
                Yellow\amp 1.333\amp \amp \\\hline
                Green\amp 1.335\amp \amp \\\hline
                Blue\amp 1.337\amp \amp \\\hline
                Indigo\amp 1.340\amp \amp \\\hline
                Violet\amp 1.344\amp \amp \\\hline
            \end{array}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Use this table and the table in the previous problem to explain why the secondary
          rainbow is above the primary rainbow and its colors are reversed.
