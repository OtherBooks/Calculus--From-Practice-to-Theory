      There is a real temptation to skip this section and get to <q>the
      Calculus part.</q> Don't do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an error for two reasons. First, the story of Calculus, what
      sorts of problems it was invented to address and why the tools of
      Calculus were developed in the way that they were, is very helpful in
      understanding what Calculus is and what it is not. Second, the real
      world problems Calculus was invented to solve are not <q>Calculus
      problems<fn>By which we mean that they are not drill problems
        designed to exercise you Calculus skills. There were, and still are,
      very hard problems in science and technology that the tools of
      Calculus can be used to solve, but only if your skills are already
      honed.</fn>.</q>
      That is, to solve these problems the techniques of Calculus are not
      the only mathematical tools that will we need. Indeed, frequently they
      will not be the first tools will need, but the last.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section addresses both precalculus<fn>Define
        precalculus and pre-calculus.</fn>and pre-calculus. The techniques
      predate Calculus and were subsequently supplanted by more general
      calculus techniques, but these techniques allow students to practice
      (relearn?) algebra and analytic geometry techniques while solving
      actual problems instead of just practice. Calculus would not exist
      without these precalculus techniques, and fluency in them will be
      crucial in applying Calculus to solve problems. So, enjoy the entire
      story of how Calculus became one of the great human achievements and
      ushered in a golden period in mathematics and science.

      <em>A Problem to Think About</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematics is such an integral part of the training of any scientist,
      that it is hard to believe that the notion of using mathematics to
      study physical phenomena is a relatively new notion. Consider, for
      example, the title page of the <em>Nova Scientia (New Science)</em> written by
      Niccolo Tartaglia in <m>1537.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      There is much allegory in this picture of which we will point out some
      items. Inside the large ring is a group of Muses including Geometria
      and Arithmetica and others surrounding Tartaglia observing the
      trajectory of a cannonball. This represents the fact that this was
      one of the first works which studied the science of projectile motion
      (artillery fire) using mathematical principles rather than empirical
      data. At the door of the ring is Euclid, representing the notion that
      one can only reach this inner ring through an understanding of
      Euclid's Elements (geometry). Clearly the man trying to scale the
      wall does not know geometry as his ladder is woefully short. The
      smaller ring, separate from the larger ring is occupied by Philosophia
      on a throne. Of course, the only entrance to the ring of philosophy
      is through the larger ring of mathematics. At that gate are
      Aristotle (on the larger ring side) and Plato (on the philosophy
      side). On the banner is the motto of Plato's Academy, <q>Let no one
      ignorant of geometry enter.</q> Of course, such allegory is open to
      interpretation, but the message is clear that mathematics would play
      an important role in the <q>new science.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to apply mathematical principles to study physical
      phenomena there must be some sort of rules which seem to govern
      nature. One of the tenets that scientists hold onto nowadays is
      {NATURE IS LAZY!} Nature tries to do things in the most
      efficient manner. Whether this is true or not, it gives a starting
      point to applying mathematics to study phenomena. This was a driving
      force to mathematicians in the <m>1600</m>s as they looked for techniques
      for optimization. We will look at some of this presently, but let's
      start with some optimization problems of our own.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Example 1:</em> Out of all rectangles with a fixed
      perimeter, which one encompasses the greatest area?
    </p>

    <p>
      One might guess that the answer is a square. To see that this is
      true, consider a square whose side is <m>s.</m> The perimeter of this square
      is <m>4s</m> and the area is <m>s^2.</m> Suppose we now increase the length by <m>x.</m>
      To maintain the same perimeter, we must now decrease the width by the
      same <m>x.</m> This <m>(s-x)</m> by <m>(s+x)</m> rectangle still has a perimeter of <m>4s,</m>
      but its area is <m>(s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt s^2.</m> Thus the square has a larger
      area than this rectangle with the same perimeter. Consider the
      following variation on the problem, which can be done in a somewhat
      similar manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Problem 1:</em> Out of all rectangles with a fixed
      perimeter, which one has the shortest diagonal? Justify your answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, Problem <m>1</m> can be done in a manner similar to
      Example <m>1.</m> But what about this problem?
    </p>

    <p>
      {Example 2.} Consider all square based boxes with a
      fixed surface area <m>S.</m> Does the cube enclose the largest volume?
      Justify you answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem may or may not be able to be solved using techniques
      similar to the above, but it is this type of optimization problem
      which prompted mathematicians from the <m>1600</m>'s to develop techniques
      that ultimately led to the invention of Calculus. We will come back
      to this problem later in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><em>Fermat's Method of Aedequality</em></em>
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the mathematicians developing techniques for solving such
      problems was Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). To address the problem of
      optimizing a function, Fermat developed a method often called the
      <em>Method of Adequality.</em> The modern word <q>adequate</q> has its origin from
      the Latin verb <em>adaequ\={a}re</em> which means to equalize. When something is
      adequate, then it is essentially being made equal to whatever your
      needs are. The equalizing appears in Fermat's method as follows.
      Fermat noticed that the values of a function <m>f(x)</m> are very nearly
      equal near a maximum or minimum value. This is noticeable during the
      year with the number of hours of daylight. At the summer and winter
      solstices, the daily change in the amount of daylight is relatively
      small as compared to that at the equinoxes. This can be seen if we
      look at a graph of this.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="56%" source="images/SantaBarbaraDaylight.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Notice that for days near the maximum which occurs at day <m>172</m> and the
      minimum which occurs at day <m>356,</m> the number of hours of daylight does
      not vary too much. This reasoning is the basis nbehind Fermat's idea
      to determine where a maximum or minimum occurs. In general, for a
      function <m>f(x),</m> we set <m>f(x+h)=f(x).</m> After performing some algebra, we
      set <m>h=0</m> to <q>make it correct.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Example <m>1,</m> we showed that out of all rectangles with a fixed
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="18%" source="images/GenericRectangle.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      perimeter, the one with the largest area is a square. We will use
      Fermat's Method of Adequality to examine a related question:
    </p>

    <p>
      {Example 3.} Out of all rectangles with a fixed area,
      does a square have the smallest perimeter?
    </p>

    <p>
      To look at this question, we need to transform it into a mathematical
      problem where we can apply Fermat's method. To do this, consider a
      rectangle whose length is given by x and width is given by <m>y.</m> The
      area of the rectangle is given by <m>A=xy</m> and the perimeter is given by
      <m>P=2x+2y.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      The mathematical problem is to minimize <m>P</m> given that <m>A</m> is fixed. To
      apply Fermat's method, we need to use our constraint <m>A=xy</m> to eliminate
      one of the variables in <m>P.</m> Solving for <m>y,</m> we get <m>y=A/x.</m> Substituting
      into <m>P,</m> we get
      <me>
        P=P(x) = 2x+\frac{2A}{x}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We used <m>P(x)</m> to emphasize that <m>P</m> is a function of <m>x</m> alone.
      (Remember that <m>A</m> is fixed.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Fermat's method says to first set <m>P(x+h)=P(x):</m>
      <me>
        2(x+h)+\frac{2A}{x+h}=2x+\frac{2A}{x}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Performing some algebra, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>2x+2h+\frac{2A}{x+h}\amp =2x+\frac{2A}{x}</mrow>
        <mrow>2h\amp =\frac{2A}{x}-\frac{2A}{x+h}</mrow>
        <mrow>h\amp =\frac{A(x+h)-Ax}{x(x+h)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{Ah}{x(x+h)}.</mrow>
        <intertext>Dividing by <m>h,</m> we get</intertext>
        <mrow>1\amp =\frac{A}{x(x+h)}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting <m>h=0,</m> <q>to make it correct,</q> we get <m>1=A/x^2,</m> so <m>x^2=A.</m>
      Substituting into the expression for <m>y,</m> we get <m>y=A/x=x^2/x=x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting this back into context, we have that <m>P</m> is optimized when
      <m>y=x;</m> that is, when the rectangle is a square. The fact that <m>P</m> is
      minimized comes from the context of the problem; a moment's thought
      tells us that by making the length as long as we wish and the width
      appropriately short, there is no maximum value for <m>P.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Reconsider the problem from earlier in the chapter.

              <p>
                Assuming that <m>V</m> is held fixed, use Fermat's Method
                    of Adequality to find the dimensions of the box which will
                    minimize <m>S.</m>  Is this box a cube?

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      If you think about Fermat's method, you quickly realize that Fermat is
      exploiting the fact that at a maximum or minimum, the tangent line to
      the curve is horizontal. In fact, Fermat modified his method to
      determine (the slope of) the tangent line to a curve. We will
      modernize Fermat's ideas as he talked of things such as subtangents
      and we have replaced that notion with slope.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you know, we need two points to determine the slope of a line, so
      with Fermat in mind, we choose two points on the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> very
      close together and use them to compute the slope of the line joining
      them.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_" >
      <caption>slope of secant line: <m>\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m></caption>
      <image width="37%" source="images/Aedequality1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      After we perform some algebra, we set <m>h=0</m> to <q>make it correct.</q>
      Setting <m>h=0</m> essentially merges the two points together and the
      secant line becomes the desired tangent line. Let's try this on the
      curve <m>y=x^2.</m> We have that the slope of secant line joining <m>(x,x^2)</m>
      and <m>(x+h,(x+h)^2)</m> is given by
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h}\amp =\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =2x+h.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting <m>h=0</m> to <q>make it correct,</q> we have that the slope of the
      tangent line at <m>(x,x^2 )</m> is given by <m>2x.</m> If we substitute the
      values <m>x=-2, -1, 0, 1,</m> and <m>2</m> we obtain slopes of <m>-4, -2, 0, 2,</m>
      and <m>4,</m> respectively. This does seem to be consistent with what we
      can see on the graph.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use Fermat's method for tangents to compute the slope of the
                  tangent line to <m>y=x^3</m> at the point <m>(x,x^3).</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Substitute the values <m>x=-2, -1, 0, 1,</m> and <m>2</m> into the formula you
                  obtained for the slope and graph this to see if it makes sense.
                  You should notice something odd about the tangent lines.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      As mentioned in the problem above, there is something a bit odd about
      the tangent lines when you graph them, though the slopes appear to be
      correct. There is also a logical problem with just letting <m>h=0</m> <q>to
      make it correct.</q> If you've spotted it, good for you (maybe your
      teacher will want to discuss it). If not, that is ok as well, for the
      method does provide the correct answer (even though the logic behind
      it is suspect). Examining these issues is for a later chapter as we
      look at the foundations of the calculus. For now, we will develop the
      rules and learn how to use them.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Fermat's Method of Tangents has a fundamental flaw (though it
      provides the correct answer), a contemporary of his, Ren&#xe9; Descartes
      <m>(1596-1650),</m> provided an alternative method which is free of logical
      issues.

  <subsection xml:id="sec_descartes-normals">
    <title>Tangent Lines: Decartes's Method of
        Normals</title>
    <p>
      <em>Apollonius and Conic Sections</em>
      The problem of finding the tangent line to a curve is a geometry
      problem, so it is not surprising that some of the first attempts
      were geometric. The Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga (circa
      262 BC to 190 BC) used geometric methods to construct tangent lines to
      the classical conic sections: the ellipse, the hyperbola, and the
      parabola.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since algebra had not yet been invented, Apollonius's methods were
      entirely geometric, and could not be easily generalized for curves
      that were not conic sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ren&#xe8; Descartes (1596-1650) was one of the pioneers in applying the
      techniques of algebra to solve geometry problems. In his <em>La
      Geometrie</em> he remarked that the problem of finding the tangent to a
      curve was <q>. . . not only the most useful and most general problem
      in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      Descartes' technique is often called the Method of Normals<fn>In this context, <q>normal</q> means
            perpendicular.</fn>because
      what he actually finds is the line normal to (perpendicular to) a
      curve. Once the normal is obtained, then the tangent line is
      perpendicular to that.
    </p>

    <p>
      His method for finding the normal to a curve can be described as
      follows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a curve and a point <m>P</m> on that curve, we find the circle
      passing through <m>P</m> whose center is on the <m>x</m> axis. The line from the
      center of that circle throught the point <m>P</m> will be the normal (and
      its perpendicular through the point (P) will be the tangent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's take a look at how this might be done in a particularly simple
      situation. Consider the line <m>y=3x+2</m> and the point <m>(1,5)</m> on that
      line.
    </p>

    <p>
      \InsertGraphic
    </p>

    <p>
      We know that the slope of the line normal to this curve<fn>Yes,
        we know that lines aren't curved. It is convenient
        to think of a line as a special case of a curve.</fn>is <m>-1/3.</m> Thus
      the normal line passes through the point <m>(1,5)</m> with slope <m>-1/3</m> so
      the equation of this line is
      <m>y-5=-\frac13(x-1)</m>
      or
      <me>
        y=-\frac13 x+\frac{16}{3}
      </me>
      which crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(16,0).</m> Since the distance from
      <m>(1,5)</m> to <m>(16,0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{122}</m> we see that the equation of the
      circle with center <m>(16, 0)</m> and radius <m>\sqrt{122}</m> is <m>(x-16)^2 +y^2
      = 122,</m> as seen below.
    </p>

    <p>
      \InsertGraphic
    </p>

    <p>
      We now have a point on our tangent line, <m>(1,5),</m> and it's slope,
      <m>3,</m> so we can write down the equation of the tangent line:
      <md>
        <mrow>y-5\amp =3(x-1), \text{ or, in slope-intercept form }</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =3x+2.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Wait a minute! That can't be! This is the equation of our original
      line!
    </p>

    <p>
      But think about it for a moment. When we say <q>tangent line</q> what do
      we really mean? The first definition we usually encounter is <q>a line
      that touches a curve at exactly one point.</q> But this can't possibly
      work as a definition for a tangent line. To see why not consider the
      tangent to the curve <m>y=x^3-3x</m> at the point <m>(-1,2).</m> It passes
      through two points on the curve: <m>(-1,2)</m> and <m>(0,2).</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      When we use the word <q>tangent</q> in ordinary speech we usually mean
      something more like, <q>getting off of the main point, but in the same
      direction that things are currently moving.</q> When we think
      of <q>tangent</q> in this way is is clear that a line and it's tangent
      must be the same line. After all, there is only one line <em>through a
      given point</em> that <em>always</em> points in a given direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      But we've gotten off on a tangent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to the problem at hand it is clear that we didn't really
      need to find the equation of our circle. Once we have the slope of the normal line,
      the slope of the tangent is known. But this is an artifact of the
      simplicity of our problem. Straight lines are easy. When the curve is
      more complex we <em>will</em> need the circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is because there is one special curve, the circle, whose tangent line is
      obvious. Pick a point on a circle and draw the radius to that
      point. It is well known that the tangent line at that point will be
      the line perpendicular to the radius.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll illustrate Descartes' idea with the following example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the slope of the normal (and tangent) line to the curve <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> at the
          point <m>(2,2).</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          <image width="75%" source="images/DescartesCircle.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Following Descartes' approach we look at the family of circles whose
          centers lie on the <m>x</m> axis and which pass through the point <m>(2,2).</m>
          The dashed circle represents a generic member of that family of
          circles. Notice that typically these circles intersect the parabola twice. We
          are searching for the circle that hits the curve only once. This is
          the solid circle in our picture. If we can find the center of that
          circle then its radius through the point <m>(2,2)</m> will be normal to the curve and we can find its
          slope (and the tangent's slope).
        </p>

        <p>
          If we let <m>(a,0)</m> denote the coordinates of the center of a generic circle in that
          family, then the equation of the circle with center <m>(a,0)</m> is
          <m>(x-a)^2+y^2=r^2</m> where <m>r</m> is the radius of the circle. Since we
          require our circle to pass through the point <m>(2,2)</m> this radius will
          be the distance from <m>(2,2)</m> to <m>(a,0).</m> That is
          <m>r=\sqrt{(2-a)^2+2^2}.</m>
          Thus we have
          <me>
            (x-a)^2+y^2=(2-a)^2+2^2.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Substituting <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> into the equation of the circle, we get

            <mrow>(x-a)^2+2x\amp =(2-a)^2+4</mrow>

          It is tempting at this point, to use the quadratic formula to solve
          for <m>x</m> and get (typically two) values for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>a.</m>
          However, before do a bunch of unnecessary work, let's keep in mind
          what we are trying to do. We want to find the value of <m>a</m> where the
          circle and the curve intersect exactly once. We really don't care
          about <m>x</m> at this point. But think about this for a moment. If we use
          the quadratic formula to solve this equation then we will get only one
          solution precisely when the discriminant (the part under the square
          root) is zero. For our problem, the discriminant is
          <m>(2-2a)^2-4(4a-8).</m> Setting this equal to zero and solving, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>4-8a+4a^2-16a+32\amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>4a^2-24a+36\amp =0</mrow>

            <mrow>a\amp =3.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the center of the circle which intersects the curve exactly once
          is <m>(3,0)</m> and the slope of the normal line is <m>(2-0)/(2-3)=-2.</m>
          So the tangent line to the curve <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> at <m>(2,2)</m> has slope
          <m>1/2.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we have both a point on the tangent line: <m>(2,2),</m> and the
          slope of the tangent line we can use the point-slope form of the
          equation of a line to write down the equation of the tangent
          line:

            y=\frac{1}{2}x+1.

      Descartes' method is not only clever, it is completely algebraic.
      But it is also unwieldy. And for curves that are more complex than
      parabolas it is often simply impossible to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Descartes' Method of Normals was not the only technique developed for
      finding tangent lines before Calculus was invented, but it is
      typical in both it's applicability and in the computational effort
      required.

          Use Descartes' Method of Normals to verify Fermat's result that the

          <m>2.</m> [You probably want to look at circles that are centered on the
          <m>y</m>-axis instead of the <m>x</m>-axis.

      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Whereas Descartes' Method is free of the logical pitfalls that
      Fermat's Method has, it is algebraically cumbersome to find where a
      polynomial has a double root. A tool to examine this was found by
      Johann van Waveren Hudde <m>(1628-1704).</m> We will state a special case
      of this rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      {Hudde's Rule:} Consider any polynomial <m>p(x)=a_0+a_1 x+ \cdots +a_n x^n.</m> Form the following <q>Hudde polynomial</q>
      <me>
        p^* (x)=a_1 x+2a_2 x^2+\ldots+na_n x^n.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>r</m> is a double root of <m>p(x),</m> then <m>r</m> is a root of the
      Hudde<fn>Put in Hudde problem later in the section on
          the product rule and the chain rule.  It could look like this:

        Recall that we introduced Hudde's Rule on page XX to search for the double root of a polynomial (if it has one).  In fact, Hudde stated a more general rule than what we gave before.

      {Hudde's Rule:}  Consider the polynomial <m>p(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\ldots{}+a_n x^n.</m> Let <m>a,b</m> be any real numbers and form the Hudde polynomial
      <me>
        p^*(x)=a_0 a+a_1 (a+b)x+a_2 (a+2b) x^2+a_3 (a+3b) x^3+\ldots+a_n
        (a+nb) x^n.
      </me>
      If <m>r</m> is a double root of <m>p(x)</m> then <m>r</m> is a root of the Hudde
      polynomial <m>p^*(x)</m> 

        Hudde proved this is a completely algebraic manner before the invention of Calculus, but with calculus, we can polish this off pretty readily.

      Another contemporary of Fermat and Descartes, Gilles Personne de
      Roberval <m>(1602-1675)</m> developed a method for constructing tangents
      which is a bit more dynamic in nature. We will explore this dynamical
      viewpoint later when we talk about Newton. For now, let's look at
      Roberval's idea. Roberval thought of a curve in the plane as being
      generated by a point whose motion is compounded from two known
      motions. By combining the <q>velocity vectors</q> of these motions, the
      tangent vector (and thus line) will result. We'll apply this concept
      to a parabola. You may think of a parabola as being determined by a
      quadratic formula (which it is), but there are other ways to describe
      it. For example, one definition is that a parabola is the set of
      points in a plane which are equidistant from a fixed point called the
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/GeometricParabola1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      focus and a fixed line called the directrix. A diagram is in Figure
      1. In Figure 1, the point <m>P</m> on the parabola is the same distance from
      the focus <m>F</m> as it is from the directrix <m>d.</m> This distance changes as <m>P</m>
      moves along the parabola, but the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>F</m> will always
      equal the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>d.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we think of the motion of <m>P</m> as being a combination of the motion
      away from <m>F</m> and the motion away from <m>d,</m> then we can modify our
      drawing to reflect this [Figure 2]. The resultant of these will
      provide the tangent to the curve at <m>P.</m>

      While this geometric approach does not produce the equation of the
      tangent line, it does have an interesting consequence in optics. To
      see this, let's examine how light reflects off a mirror. As we had
      noted earlier, when applying mathematics to natural phenomena, people
      often start with the assumption that nature is lazy; that is, nature
      tries to optimize. Take, for example, a beam of light. If one were
      to shine a laser pointer in a room, then it would be reasonable to
      assume that light travels in a straight line which minimizes distance
      traveled. This premise is reflected<fn>Pun intended.</fn>in light
      reflecting off a mirror. Assuming that light travels the shortest
      path, we can examine what path light would travel in this case.
      Mathematically, we are given two points <m>A,</m> <m>B</m> and a line <m>m</m> (for
      mirror, not slope). We wish to find the shortest path from <m>A</m> to <m>m</m>
      to <m>B.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="images/ReflectingMirror1.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This can be done without Calculus by reflecting <m>B</m> across <m>m.</m> We will
      denote this reflection by <m>B_R.</m> Clearly the shortest path from <m>A</m> to <m>m</m>
      to <m>B_R</m> is a straight line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="images/ReflectingMirror2.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, this says that the solid straight line path in the above
      picture is shorter than the dotted path. If we reflect the parts of
      the paths that are below line <m>m,</m> then the solid path will still be
      shorter than the dotted path.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="images/ReflectingMirror3.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This solid path represents the shortest path from <m>A</m> to <m>m</m> to <m>B.</m> Notice
      that on this shortest path, we have the following situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="images/ReflectingMirror4.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      To sum up, this says that by traveling the shortest path, light
      reflects off of a mirror so that the angle of incidence, <m>\angle 1,</m> is
      congruent to the angle of reflection, <m>\angle 3.</m>
    </p>

      <image width="37%" source="images/Telescopes.png" />
      the axis of the parabola (perpendicular to the directrix) will reflect
      off the parabola to the focus. Among other things, this is why
      satellite dishes and primary mirrors in reflective telescopes are
      parabolic.

          Consider that an ellipse is the set of points in a plane, the sum of
          whose distances from two fixed points (foci) is a constant. Using
          Roberval's idea, we can think of the motion of a point <m>P</m> on the
          <image width="37%" source="images/Ellipse.png" />
          ellipse as being the result of a motion away from one focus and
          toward the other focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Explain why the parallelogram in the figure must be a rhombus and

    <p>
      Again, applying this to optics, this says that any light ray, sound
      wave, etc. emanating from one focus will reflect off of the ellipse to
      the other focus. Among other things, this reflective property is used
      to treat kidney stones. The treatment is called Extracorporeal Shock
      Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and is really what the name says. Lithotripsy
      literally means <q>rock grinding,</q> and this technique uses shock waves
      which are generated outside the body [See figures below]
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/CassegrainTelescope.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      As you can see in the second figure, the table contains a cup which is
      in the shape of part of an ellipse. At one focus of the ellipse is an
      electrode which generates shock waves. These shock waves reflect off
      the elliptical cup and converge on the other focus. When the kidney
      stone is positioned at that focus, the shock waves will pummel it into
      small pieces which can be passed relatively painlessly through the
      ureter.

      A hyperbola is the set of points in the plane, the difference of whose
      distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. This idea is

      We've examined the reflection of light (without Calculus); what about
      refraction of light as it passes from one medium to another, say from
      water to air.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="images/Refraction1.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that light does not travel the shortest path anymore, as this
      would be a straight line from the fish to the kingfisher. This seems
      incongruous with our tenet before that nature will be lazy and light
      will travel the shortest path. We will get to that in a moment, but
      for now we will try to determine what the path of refracted light is.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical law is known as Snell's Law, named after the Dutch
      Astronomer Willebrord Snellius <m>(1580-1626)</m> though it was accurately
      described before that time. In modern terms, Snell's Law can be
      stated as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Snell's Law of Refraction:</em> Suppose that light travels
      with a velocity of <m>v_1</m> in medium <m>1</m> and velocity <m>v_2</m> in medium
      <m>2.</m>
      <image width="84%" source="images/Refraction2.png" />
      Then the path that light follows satisfies
      <me>
        \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{v_1} = \frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{v_2 }.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A number of mathematicians (including Snell) provided derivations of
      this, but we will focus (a bit) on Fermat. To attack this problem,
      Fermat assumed that light would travel the fastest path, not
      necessarily the shortest path. Notice that this is not incongruous
      with our observations concerning reflecting light. In that case, the
      speed of light was constant so the shortest path was, in fact, the
      fastest path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's see what happens when we try to use Fermat's Method of
      Adequality to find this fastest path.
    </p>

    <problem xml:id="FermatSnell">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the following labeling in the above diagram:
          <image width="75%" source="images/Refraction3.png" />

          <m>B</m> in terms of the variable <m>x</m> and the constants <m>a, b, c, v_1, v_2.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      If you try to apply Fermat's Method of Adequality to minimize T, you
      will run across some pretty daunting algebra. You should try to start
      this, but don't get discouraged if you can't complete the algebra. (We
      couldn't do it either.) The square roots involved make the algebra
      difficult at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somehow Fermat was able to minimize this and derive Snell's Law, but
      there aren't many Fermats around. What about the rest of us? This is
      where Newton and Leibniz come in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deriving Snell's Law was the second application in Leibniz's <m>1684</m> paper
      on Calculus, <em>A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents,
      Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, and
      a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The title may be long, but it is very revealing. Clearly, the problem
      of optimizing (finding maxima and minima) is of central importance (as
      we mentioned before) and somehow finding tangent lines to curves is
      involved. Also, it is not impeded by fractional (exponents) nor
      irrational quantities (square roots). In this paper, Leibniz remarks,
      <q>Other very learned men [such as Fermat] have sought in many devious
      ways what someone versed in this Calculus can accomplish in these
      lines as by magic.</q>

      We will come back to the problem of deriving Snell's Law, utilizing
      these systematic rules and techniques, but first we need to develop
      these rules and become fluent with them before we can perform our
      <q>magic.</q>
