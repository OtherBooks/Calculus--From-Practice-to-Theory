  <title>The Shape of Things</title>
  <p>
    Whether we use Newton's dynamic view or Leibniz's more geometric
    interpretation of the techniques of Calculus is largely a matter of
    choice, and personal preference. For some problems Newton's
    interpretation is more natural and easier to use, for others Leibniz's
    viewpoint is better. What is important is that we recognize that
    neither approach <em>is</em> The Calculus. They are ways of
    interpreting, or <q>thinking about</q> The Calculus.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this section we will try to think about Calculus directly, without
    any metaphors between us and the topic. For the most part we will
    fail, but never mind that. This is just our first attempt. We will get
    better.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the previous two sections<fn>specifically, on
    <xref ref="list_FirstDerivTest-Newton">pages</xref>, <xref ref="list_FirstDerivTest-Lines"></xref>
    and <xref ref="list_FirstDerivTest-Leibniz"></xref></fn>we saw that the derivative
    gives us information about curves in much the same way that the slope
    of a straight line gives us information about the line. The only
    difference is that since the numerical value of the derivative changes
    at each point it only gives us <em>local</em> information about the
    curve at that point. Whereas the slope gives us global information
    about the whole line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, since we reached the same conclusions regardless of whether
    we used Newton's or Leibniz's point of view, we can be reasonably
    confident that our conclusions are independent of which point of view we
    use. That is, we can be sure that what we have found are fundamental
    truths of The Calculus itself. We repeat these conclusions in the
    abstract:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>Increasing Functions:</title>
        <p>
          If the derivative of a function is
            positive at some point then the function is increasing at that
            point.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <title>Decreasing Functions:</title>
        <p>
          If the derivative of a function is
            negative at some point then the function is decreasing at that
            point.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    As simple and intuitive as this seems there are two problems with
    it. We will need to proceed carefully.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <image width="37%" source="images/Abstract1.png" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    The first problem is, what do we mean by increasing and decreasing?
  </p>

  <p>
    No, really. What do we mean?
  </p>

  <p>
    You've been taught all of your life that increasing means <q>rising to
    the right</q> and that decreasing means <q>dropping to the right.</q> Thus
    the graph at the right is usually said to be is increasing from the
    far left to a point somewhere between zero and one, decreasing from
    that point to a point somewhere between three and four, and then
    increasing again thereafter. That interpretation is deeply tied to
    the convention of saying that as we go farther to the right on the
    <m>x</m>-axis the values of <m>x</m> get bigger. But this is only a convention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conventions are handy, but they are not reality. If, for some reason,
    we had adopted the convention that moving farther to the <em>left</em>
    causess the value of <m>x</m> to increase then we would say (reading
    right-to-left) that this graph decreases first, then increases for a
    while, and then decreases again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The good news here is that we <em>will</em> be adopting the usual
    conventions so we can say, loosely, that a graph is increasing if it
    rises as we move to the right. <em>But</em> keep in mind that what
    this really means is that a function, <m>f(x),</m> gets bigger if <m>x</m> gets
    bigger. Which direction means <q>bigger</q> depends entirely on the
    context of a given problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Resolving this issue was simply a matter of recognizing our own
    convention. Such difficulties are usually easy to resolve once we
    realize that's what they are. However, distinguishing between a
    convention (especially one as old and comfortable as this one) and
    reality can be very difficult because conventions, once we've gotten
    comfortable with them, begin to feel as if they are <em>actual</em>
    reality. They are not.
  </p>

  <p>
    But we have another problem and this one cannot be resolved by
    noticing that we've mistaken a convention for reality. We stated above
    that if the derivative of some function <m>f(x),</m> is positive at some
    point <m>x=a,</m> then <m>f(x)</m> is increasing <em>at that point.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem is, what does it mean to be increasing at a single point?
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to know that <m>f(x)</m> has increased we need to move away from
    <m>x=a</m> to some point (to the right of <m>a</m> in our adopted convention),
    say <m>x=a+h,</m> and see if <m>f(a+h)</m> is bigger than <m>f(a).</m> But even if
    <m>f(a+h)</m> <em>is</em> bigger the only information we have is that
    <m>f(a+h)>f(a).</m> This does not guarantee that <m>f(x)</m> was increasing the
    whole time. That is, there might be some point between <m>a</m> and <m>a+h</m> <mdash /> let's call it <m>\alpha,</m> <mdash /> where <m>f(\alpha)\lt f(a).</m> Even worse there
    might be some point, <m>\beta</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>\alpha</m> where
    <m>f(\beta)>f(a).</m> Yet again there might <em>another</em> point <m>\gamma</m>
    between <m>a</m> and <m>\beta</m> where <m>f(\gamma) \lt  f(a),</m> again. And so on
    <m>\ldots</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    If the distance between <m>a</m> and <m>a+h</m> is very small (that is, if <m>h</m>
    is very small) and if <m>f(a+h)>f(a),</m> it is very easy to
    <em>believe</em> that <m>f(x)</m> increased through all of the points from
    <m>a</m> to <m>a+h.</m> But belief is not knowledge. In fact, we have no
    information whatsoever about the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> between <m>a</m> and
    <m>a+h.</m> We simply know that when <m>x=a+h</m> the function was greater than
    it was at <m>x=a.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is getting very hard to think about isn't it? That's because what
    we are getting caught on here is one of Zeno's
    Paradoxes<fn>Specifically, the arrow paradox. Briefly, Zeno said
      that an arrow in flight can't really move. This is because to get
      from where it is now, to any other point in space it has to traverse
      all of the (infinitely many) points in between. But this is also
      true of all of those points. Thus before the arrow can move once it
      has to move infinitely many times. That's crazy.</fn>. If you have never
    heard of the Greek philosopher Zeno, you really should {G{o}{o}{g}{l}{e}}him. He's an interesting guy.
  </p>

  <p>
    But wait until you are done with your Calculus for today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's how we get around this difficulty. We all know what we mean
    when we say that a curve is increasing at a point. The mental image
    that is generated is very clear. The problem is that any attempt to
    put this into words runs headlong into Zeno and his paradox. We cannot
    solve this problem, so we will simply go around it. That is, we first
    recognize that the usual intuitive meaning of the word increasing does
    not apply at a single point, since we need at least two points to say
    we've increased from one to the other. We are thus free to define the
    phrase <q>increasing at a point</q> in any manner we choose. We choose
    the following:
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_first-deriv-test">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the graph of the function <m>y(x),</m> at some point <m>(a, y(a)).</m>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The graph is said to be <em>increasing</em> at <m>x=a</m> if <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a} > 0</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The graph is said to be <em>decreasing</em><fn>Notice that
                    our definition does <em>not</em> address the situation
                    <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}=0.</m> Since the definition does not address
                    this we say that the function is neither increasing nor
                    decreasing when <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a}=0.</m></fn>at <m>x=a</m> if
                  <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{x=a} \lt  0</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Does this feel like cheating to you? It probably does. After all,
    what have we really accomplished? We took our highly intuitive
    observation above, that if the derivative is positive then the
    function is increasing, and turned it around to make it a
    definition. It probably seems like we're blathering on about nothing
    at all, making easy things seem difficult and getting lost in a jungle
    of logical pecadillos. This is the usual criticism brought against
    mathematicians and mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>
    But stop and think about this just a little more deeply. Is that
    really all that we've done?
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose we we would like to know when a function is increasing and
    when it is decreasing (we do). In the absence of any other tools,
    our only option is to look at the value of the function here, then
    look at it over there, and decide which is bigger. Unfortunately, as
    Zeno pointed out this tells us exactly nothing about what happened in
    between. So we are obliged to look at a point in between, and another,
    and another <m>\ldots</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, if we know the derivative of our curve all we have
    to do is check, to see for which values of <m>x</m> the derivative is
    positive (function is increasing) and for which it is negative
    (function is decreasing). Most of the time we don't have to look at
    the points one at a time. We can consider entire classes of points all
    at once.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
    <p>
      For example, consider the function whose derivative is <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=
        3x^2-3.</m> Can you tell us where this curve is increasing and where it
      is decreasing?
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure you can. Since <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is positive when <m>x\lt -1</m> and when
      <m>x>1,</m> but negative when <m>-1\lt x\lt 1.</m> Thus our curve increases until
      <m>x=-1,</m> decreases from <m>x=-1</m> to <m>x=1</m> and increases thereafter.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Do the computations necessary to show that <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is
          positive when <m>x\lt -1</m> and when <m>x>1,</m> but negative when <m>-1\lt x\lt 1.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then find at least one function whose derivative is <m>3x^2-3,</m>
          graph it, and confirm that it increases when <m>x\lt -1</m> and when
          <m>x>1,</m> and decreases when <m>-1\lt x\lt 1.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    <xref ref="def_first-deriv-test">Definition</xref> is sometimes called the First
    Derivative Test, but such an imposing name seems unnecessarily
    overblown to us. On the other hand, we mention the name because it
    suggests that there might be something called a Second Derivative
    Test, and indeed there is. Here's what it says: If the second
    derivative of a function is positive at a point then the graph of the
    function is concave upward at that point. If the second
    derivative of a function is negative at a point then the graph of the
    function is concave downward at that point.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly this will not make sense until we've understood all of the
    words being used. For example, what can <q>concave upward</q> possibly
    mean. We will illuminate this with the following examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each of the following graphs:
    <image width="75%" source="images/ConcaveUp.png" />
    exemplifies the idea of <q>concave up,</q> whereas the following graphs are <q>concave down.</q>
    <image width="75%" source="images/ConcaveDown.png" />
  </p>

  <p>
    Obviously concave up means <q>a bowl that opens up,</q> and concave down
    means ``a bowl that opens down. However it is easy to get the wrong
    impression from simple examples so let's look at some more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Is this graph
    <image width="56%" source="images/ConcaveUpDown.png" />
    concave up or concave down?
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly it is both. On the interval <m>(0,\pi)</m> it is concave down and
    on the interval <m>(\pi,2\pi)</m> it is concave up. So this notion is like
    increasing/decreasing in that we will always need to specify the
    interval on which a given function is either concave up or concave down.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now what about these two?
    <image width="75%" source="images/ConcaveUpDownUnclear.png" />
  </p>

  <p>
    The graph on the left is clearly<fn>Never mind that we can't
      actually see <em>all</em> of the graph.</fn>concave up when <m>x\lt 0,</m> but
    what about when <m>x>0?</m> Is it concave up there? Concave down? Neither?
    Both? It is very hard to tell from the graph. The one on the right is
    similarly vague in the region around <m>x=0.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly, if it is important for us to distiguish concave up from
    concave down<fn>It is.</fn>we will need a more precise method
    than simply looking at graphs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's proceed slowly. Since we're studying Calculus the derivative
    will probably be instrumental in our understanding of concavity, so we
    ask what we can determine about the derivative of a function whose
    graph is concave up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider our first example <m>y(x) = x^2+1.</m> This is concave up
    everywhere so we will consider how its derivative changes as <m>x</m> moves
    increases. The following sketches show the graph and
    its tangent at <m>x=1,</m> <m>x=2,</m> and <m>x=3.</m>
    <image width="75%" source="images/ConcaveUpWithTangent.png" />
    Notice that as <m>x</m> increases the tangent line gets steeper and
    steeper. That is to say its slope gets larger. Or, even more formally,
    the derivative increases.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Look back up to the graph of the other <q>concave up</q> examples and
        convince yourself that this is true of all of them: As <m>x</m> increases
        the derivative of each function also increases.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Does that mean that the derivative of a concave down function will
    decrease as <m>x</m> increases? Yes, of course it does.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Look back up to the graph of the <q>concave down</q> examples and
        convince yourself that this is true of all of them: As <m>x</m> increases
        the derivative of each function decreases.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    So, apparently in order to distinguish where a function is concave up
    from where it is concave down we need to locate where the derivative
    is increasing and where it is decreasing. If only we had a tool to
    tell us when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing the
    problem would be solved.
  </p>

  <p>
    But we do! That's exactly what the First Derivative Test tells us! If
    we want to know where the graph of <m>y(x)</m> is increasing or decreasing
    we look at its derivative, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and find where this is
    positive or negative.
  </p>

  <p>
    To find out where the graph of <m>y(x)</m> is concave up or concave down,
    we ask where its derivative, <m>\dfdx{y}{x},</m> is increasing and where it
    is decreasing. Where the derivative is increasing the graph of <m>y(x)</m>
    will be concave up and where it is decreasing the graph of <m>y(x)</m> will
    be concave down.
  </p>

  <p>
    To determine where the derivative is increasing or decreasing we need
    to look at the <em>derivative of the derivative,</em> <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}</m>
    and ask where it is positive and where it is negative.
  </p>

  <p>
    So apparently the derivative of <m>y(x)</m> can tell us where a function is
    increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down. This is actually quite a lot to tell
  </p>
