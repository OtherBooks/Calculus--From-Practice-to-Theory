      In the last chapter, we looked at some pre-calculus techniques
      invented the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz. Clever as these ad-hoc
      techniques were, they were very limited in their applicability.
      Newton and Leibniz were well-aware of these techniques, and their
      limitations. Newton was the first to develop his calculus during a
      two-year period at his home in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, UK when
      Cambridge was closed due to an outbreak of plague in <m>1665.</m> He was
      under <m>25</m> at the time. Leibniz independently developed his rules for
      calculus while employed as a diplomat in Paris during the period
      <m>1672-1674.</m> He was <m>26</m> at the time. Though their approaches are
      fundamentally different, their results were essentially the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newton preferred to think of quantities as changing with time
      (fluents) and developed rules for computing their instantaneous rates
      of change (fluxions), whereas Leibniz focused on infinitely small
      differences (differentials). They and their contemporaries,
      recognized that these different approaches were equivalent. We will
      eventually see this as well. Each approach has its advantages. We
      will start with Leibniz's geometric approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Newton probably discoverd his Calculus first, Leibniz published the first
      paper on Calculus in <m>1684.</m> In his paper,
    </p>

    <sidebyside>
      {A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents,
            Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational
            Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This}
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Leibniz provides rules for computing and
      applications of his differential calculus. Literally speaking,
      differential calculus means <q>rules for differences.</q>
      Leibniz (and Newton)aassumed that a varying quantity could be
      increased or decreased by an infinitely small amound that he called an
      infinitesimal difference, or just a differential. So if <m>x</m> is some quantity, then its differential <m>\d x</m> represents an infinitely
      small increase or decrease in <m>x.</m> This may sound a little strange to
      you, to talk of infinitesimal changes, and in truth, Leibniz did not
      try to define what an infinitesimal was. Mathematicians had
      successfully, and informally, used the the notion before Leibniz and he did
      the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neither Leibniz nor Newton let such matters disturb them greatly. They
      developed their computational schemes, verified that they worked, and
      that was enough for them. They didn't let foundational questions like,
      <q>What does it mean for an increment to be infinitely small, and yet
      not zero?</q> paralyze them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nor will we.
    </p>

    <p>
      However this question will turn out to be important and will
      eventually we will have to address it. Foundational problems are not something to
      be swept under the rug and ignored. If we do not proceed carefully
      from clearly stated first principles, using solid logical arguments we
      can never really know if what we are doing is valid or not. So this
      question as to the nature of an infinitely small magnitude is
      paramount. If we do not resolve it all of our work will rest on an
      unstable foundation and we can never really know whether it is valid
      or not. We <em>must</em> address this problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      But not right now. Newton, Leibniz and their contemporaries
      did truly amazing things by working intuitively, and there is no
      reason we can't do the same. At first. So we will hold of these
      <q>foundational issues</q> until we have gained a solid intuitive
      understanding of Calculus.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have precedent for this. All of geometry depends on the notion of
      a mathematical point which has no length, width, or height. But what
      is that, really, but a useful fiction. Usually it is dismissed as an
      undefined term, but that says nothing more or less than that we don't
      know what it is. For now, we will treat the notion of an infinitely
      small, but non-zero, magnitude (a differential) in much the same
      manner, focusing on its utility rather than its existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The utility of a differential comes not from trying to measure its
      (infinitesimal) size, but from looking at the relationship between
      differentials. Specifically, if we have two (or more) quantities, <m>x</m>
      and <m>y,</m> related by some equation, then we want to apply the rules of
      Calculus to create a <q>differential equation</q> relating the
      differential of <m>y,</m> <m>\d{y}</m> to the differential of <m>x,</m> <m>\d{x}.</m> The
      process of finding the differential of a quantity is called
      differentiation. In some applications, we will use the problem to
      define a differential equation and use this to see how the quantities
      are related. This reverse process is called antidifferentiation.
      Before we go any further, let's state the rules for differentiation:
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules for differentiation are surprisingly easy to learn and
      remember. Moreover there are only seven of them.
      In fact, you are already familiar with the first <m>3</m> rules in a
      different context. Recall that the slope of a line is given by
      <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> where <m>\Delta y</m> is the (finite) change in
      <m>y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> is the (finite) change in <m>x.</m> We know that if <m>x</m>
      is constant (unchanging) then
      <m>{\Delta x} =0.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      The only difference between this and the infinitesimal case is that we
      think of the increments as infinitesimally small rather than
      finite. Leibniz used the letter <m>"d"</m> to indicate differentials. Thus
      just as <m>\Delta x</m> is a finite change in <m>x,</m> <m>\d{x}</m> in an
      infinitesimal change in <m>x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      So if, for example, <m>x</m> is constantly <m>7,</m> then both
      <m>(\Delta x)</m> and <m>\d{x}</m> are equal to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      So we have the following rule:
    </p>

    <p>
      {Differentiation Rule <hash />1:} If <m>c</m> is a constant, then <m>\d c=0.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first rule was particularly simple since only one quantity was
      involved and it was unchanging. The second is only slightly more
      complex. Suppose we have two varying quantities, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> which are
      related by the formula:
      <m>y=3x.</m> We'd like to find the relationship between the differentials,
      <m>\d{y}</m> and <m>\d{x}.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Again the finite case is illuminating. If <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are two
      different values of <m>x,</m> and <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are the corresponding
      values of <m>y</m> then clearly:
      <md>
        <mrow>\Delta y \amp = y_2-y_1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 3x_2-3x_1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 3(x_2-x_1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 3\Delta x.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly there is nothing special about the constant <m>3</m> so we have the
      following, sometimes called the Constant Multiple rule:
    </p>

    <p>
      {Differentiation Rule <hash />2:} If <m>a</m> is a constant, then <m>\d(ax)=a\d x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are again varying quantities then the
      following rule, sometimes called the Sum Rule, is also true.
    </p>

    <p>
      {Differentiation Rule <hash />3:} <m>\d(x+y)=\d x+\d y.</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show, by an argument similar to the one we use for Rule <hash />2 that
          Rule <hash />3 is also valid.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      In most cases it is not the differentials themselves but the
      relationship between two related differentials that is most useful.
      To see this consider the line <m>y=4x+7.</m> Applying our differentiation rules
      to this we create the differential equation
      <me>
        \d{y}=\d(4x+7)=\d(4x)+\d(7)=4\d{x}+0=4\d{x}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this differential equation can be rewritten as
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=4</m> which says that the
      the slope of the line <m>y=4x+7</m> is <m>4.</m> Of course you knew that
      already, but again, what is important here is that it is the
      relationship between the differentials <m>\d{y}</m> and <m>\d{x}</m> that is
      useful and informative.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="28%" source="images/ProductRule1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Conceptually, the difference between the formula:
      <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =4</m> and <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=4</m> that in the first
      we think of <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> as finite, whereas <m>\d{y}</m> and
      <m>\d{x}</m> are infinitesimals. Otherwise both say that the slope of this
      line is <m>4.</m> The reason for making a distinction between finite
      changes <m>\Delta y,</m> <m>\Delta x,</m> and infinitesimal changes <m>\d y,</m>
      <m>\d x,</m> will become clear we try to compute the slope of (the tangent
      line to) a non-linear function.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/ProductRule.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      To see this rule, we will use an area model. With this in mind,
      consider the area <m>A</m> of a rectangle with side lengths <m>x</m> and <m>y.</m>
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="28%" source="images/gnomon1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we increase (or decrease) <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> by infinitesimal amounts <m>\d x,</m> and <m>\d y</m>
      respectively, then the area will change by an infinitely small amount
      as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The change in area <m>\d A</m> is represented by the <m>L</m> shaped region (
      called a gnomon) on the right and top of the rectangle. Clearly
      <md>
        <mrow>\d A\amp =(x+\d x)-(y+\d y)-xy</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =xy+x\d y+y\d y+\d x \d y-xy</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =x\d y+y\d x+\d x \d y.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The three terms which make up <m>\d A</m> can be seen in the figure at the
      right.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where we deviate from the world of finite differences and
      utilize the fact that we are working with infinitesimals. Since
      <m>\d x</m> and <m>\d y</m> are both infinitely small, then their product
      <m>\d x\d y</m> is infinitely small compared to either of them, so we will
      conveniently ignore it<fn>Notice that we have just asserted that
        <m>y\d{x}</m> and <m>\d{y}\d{x}</m> are both and infinitely small (since
        <m>\d{A}</m> is) but that <m>\d{y}\d{x}</m> is <em>so much smaller than
          <m>y\d{x}</m></em> that it is effectively zero so we can ignore it. This
        should bother you. If it does then know that you are in very good
        company.  Leibniz himself struggled to find the correct product
        rule. When he his original calculus paper he did not provide a
        justification, writing instead <q>The demonstration of this will be
        easy to one who is experienced in these matters <m>\ldots</m></q> This is a
        foundational matter that we promise to come back to. In the mean
        time if the looseness of our reasoning here bothers you, consider
        declaring a math major. We do lots of this stuff.)</fn>. This leaves us with

      Recall that the title of Leibniz's first paper on Calculus made

      maxima or minima?</q> Good question! Our gateway to this
      comes in the form of an old friend, the slope of a line.
