      { A Problem to Think About:
      }

      *********************

      Consider the region bounded by <m>y=x^2,</m> <m>y=0,</m> <m>x=1,</m> <m>x=4</m> as below
      <image width="93%" source="images/FTC-1.png" />
      The problem at hand is to compute the area of this region. With this
      in mind, suppose we place an infinitely skinny box in that region as
      below.
      <image width="93%" source="images/FTC-2.png" />
      The height of this generic box is y. As we've done in the past with
      differentiation, we will denote the width of the box by <m>\d x.</m> Thus the
      area of this generic box is thus <m>y\d x.</m> If we envision this region as
      being composed of such boxes, then the area of this region would be
      the (infinite) sum of the areas of these boxes, as below
      <image width="93%" source="images/FTC-3.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      You might wonder, looking at the picture, how we can say that the
      area of the (curved) region can be the sum of rectangular boxes.
      Bear in mind that the drawing above is not totally accurate as the
      boxes are infinitely skinny and there are infinitely many of them.
      Later we will examine this more carefully and use this observation
      to approximate areas under more complicated curves, but for now
      let's imagine that the boxes are infinitely skinny. We will see, as
      mathematicians saw in the 1700's, that this will be very fruitful.
      We need some notation for this sum. Originally, Leibniz used the
      notation omn which was short for the Latin word omnis meaning all.
      Shortly after, he replaced omn with an elongated s which stood for
      the latin word summa (sum). We use this notation today and write
      the sum of these infinite areas as
      <me>
        \text{ Total area }  =\int_{x=1}^4 y \d x =\int_{x=1}^4x^2 \d x.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      As we will see, having a good notation will help when we apply this
      technique to more applications that go beyond computing areas, but it
      doesn't tell us how to add infinitely many, infinitely small areas.
      Surprisingly, we actually have the tools to accomplish this task, and
      this realization was one of the things that made calculus such a great
      tool from the 1700's until now. To do this with our above example,
      let's choose a random value <m>x=b</m> and let <m>A(b)</m> denote the area under the
      curve <m>y=x^2</m> from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=b.</m> In other words,
      <me>
        A(b)=\int_{x=1}^bx^2 \d x.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we increase <m>b</m> by the infinitely small differential <m>\d b.</m>
      If <m>\d A</m>
      denotes the corresponding change in area, then we have <m>\d A=y(b)\d x=b^2
      \d b.</m> [See below.]
      <image width="75%" source="images/FTC-4.png" />
      To recap, we have this function <m>A(b),</m> we don't have a formula for it,
      but we know some things about it.
      <me>
        \dfdx{A}{b}=b^2,\ \      A(1)=0
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We know how to solve this antidifferentiation problem.
      <me>
        A(b)=\frac{b^3}{3}+C
      </me>
      where <m>C</m> is a constant. Using the fact that <m>A(1)=0,</m> we get
      <md>
        <mrow>0\amp =A(1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{1^3}{3}+C \text{ so that }</mrow>
        <mrow>C\amp =-\frac{1^3}{3}.</mrow>
        <intertext>Thus we have</intertext>
        <mrow>\int_{x-1}^bx^2\d x \amp = A(b)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{b^3}{3}=\frac{1^3}{3}.</mrow>
        <intertext>Letting <m>b=4,</m> we get</intertext>
        <mrow>\int_{x-1}^bx^2\d x \amp = \frac{4^3}{3}-\frac{1^3}{3}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{63}{3}= 21.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      We could apply the same technique to compute
      <me>
        \int_{x=0}^\pi\sin x\d x.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting <m>A(b) = \int_{x=0}^b\sin x\d x</m> and letting <m>\d b</m> denote an
      infinitely small change in <m>b,</m> we have <m>\d A=\sin b\d b</m> which leads
      to the antidifferentiation problem
      <me>
        \dfdx{A}{b} = \sin b,\ A(0)=0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Solving this, we get
      <me>
        A(b) =-\cos b+C.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the initial condition <m>0=A(0)=-\cos 0+C,</m> gives <m>C=-(-\cos0)</m> so
      that
      <me>
        \int_{x=0}^b\sin x\d x = A(b) = -\cos b-(-\cos 0)
      </me>
      and so
      <me>
        \int_{x=0}^b\sin x\d x = -\cos\pi-(-\cos 0)=1+1=2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that we deliberately did not simplify the above equation right
      away as it demonstrates how our technique can be generalized.
      Specifically, suppose we have a function, <m>y=y(x)</m> with an antiderivative <m>Y,</m> that
      is <m>\dfdx{Y}{x}=y.</m> To compute <m>A(b)=\int_{x=a}^by\d x,</m> notice that
      we have
      <me>
        \dfdx{A}{b}=y(b), \ A(a)=0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Solving this antidifferentiation problem, we have
      <me>
        A(b)=Y(b)+C.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the initial condition, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>0\amp =A(a)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =Y(a)+C \text{ so that }</mrow>
        <mrow>C\amp =-Y(a).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus
      <me>
        \int_{x-a}^by\d x = A(b)=Y(b)-Y(a).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The amazing fact that an area problem can be reduced to an
      antidifferentiation problem is called the Fundamental Theorem of
      Calculus, and can be summarized as follows.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}
          If <m>Y</m> is an antiderivative of <m>y,</m> then
          <me>
            \int_{x=a}^b y\d x = Y(b)-Y(a).
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Notice that the Fundamental Theorem states that <m>Y</m> is
      <em>an</em> antiderivative of <m>y</m> not <em>the</em>
      antiderivative. This is because if a function has an antiderivative,
      then it has many<fn>Infinitely many, in fact.</fn>. The theorem does
      not require that we find a particular antiderivative. Any of them will
      do.
