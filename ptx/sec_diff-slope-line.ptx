  <title>Differentials and the Slope of a Line</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have the idea of infinitesimal differentials, the familiar
      idea that the slope of a line is the change in y divided by the change
      in <m>x</m> can be extended to more general curves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that if a curve is not a straight line then the slope will
      change from point to point on the curve. For example, consider the
      parabola <m>y=x^2:</m>
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/parabola1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Notice that on the left side of the <m>y</m> axis, the slope appears to be
      negative while on the right side, it appears to be positive.
      Furthermore, as you move away from the origin, the curve appears to be
      steeper (so the slope would be larger in magnitude). How does one
      compute this slope?
    </p>

    <p>
      First, since we are good at dealing with lines, let's look at the
      tangent line to the parabola at the point <m>(x,x^2).</m> If you recall
      from the previous section, Fermat determined that the slope of this
      tangent line is given by <m>2x.</m> This should ring a bell. We just used
      Leibniz's rules to show that <m>\d (x^2)=2x\d x.</m> This would suggest
      that if <m>y=x^2,</m> then <m>\d y/\d x=\d (x^2)/\d x=2x\d x/\d x=2x.</m> Since <m>\d x</m>
      is an infinitely small change in <m>x,</m> and <m>\d y</m> is the infinitely
      small change in <m>y</m> along the curve, does the quotient of these
      changes give the slope of the tangent line?
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we are talking about infinitely small changes, let's get
      infinitely close to the curve at the generic point <m>(x,x^2)</m> to see
      what is happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="75%" source="images/parabola-zoom.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      These images seem to suggest that as we zoom in, it is getting harder
      to distinguish between the curve and the tangent line. If we could
      zoom in infinitely close, then the curve and the tangent line would
      become indistinguishable, so it makes sense that the slope of the
      curve <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is also the slope of the tangent line. In the
      previous chapter, we saw that it is very hard to use Fermat's method to determine
      the slope of the tangent line to the curve <m>y=x^3</m> at the point
      <m>(x,x^3).</m> However, using Leibniz's rules gives
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\d(x^3 )}{\d x}=\frac{3x^2 \d x}{\d x}=3x^2.</m> Does
      this match your answer from before? Maybe this really is a <q>New
      Method for Tangents.</q>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have all heard that the tangent line to a circle is perpendicular
          to the radius. Of course, this can be proven geometrically (You may
          have seen such a proof). We even used this fact in Descartes'
          Method of Normals. Find the slope <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> of the tangent line to the
          circle <m>x^2+y^2=r^2</m> at the point <m>(x,y)</m> and verify that the radius and
          the tangent line are in fact perpendicular.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Solving problems such as the previous ones show that these Calculus
      rules seem to work, even if the foundations are questionable. But
      wait! What about the curve <m>y=\sqrt{2x}?</m> We used Descartes' Method of
      Normals to find the slope of the tangent line to this curve at the
      point <m>(2,2).</m> Can Leibniz do this problem as well with his <q>New
      Method?</q> First notice that <m>y=\sqrt{2}\cdot x^{1/2}.</m> Since <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is a constant,
      which we know how to handle, it becomes a matter of differentiating
      <m>x^{1/2}.</m> Would Leibniz' Power rule work for this as well? Let's
      see. If we wanted to differentiate <m>y=x^{1/2},</m> we could rewrite this
      as <m>y^2=x.</m> Differentiating, we obtain
      <md>
        <mrow>\d(y^2)\amp =\d x</mrow>
        <mrow>2y \d y\amp =\d x</mrow>
        <mrow>\d y\amp =1/2y \d x</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =1/2x^{1/2} \d x</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =1/2 x^{-1/2} \d x</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =1/2  x^(1/2-1) \d x</mrow>
        <intertext>Thus we see that the slope of the tangent line to <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> at <m>(2,2)</m> is given
           by</intertext>
        <mrow>\left. \dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=2}\amp =\left.\sqrt{2} \left(\frac12
               x^{-1/2}\right)\right|_{x=2}=1/2.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This should match what you obtained before.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>y=x^{p/q},</m> where <m>p,</m> and <m>q</m> are positive integers. Mimic the
          derivation above to show that
          <me>
            \d x^{p/q}=p/q x^{p/q-1} \d x.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, as Leibniz said, <q><m>\ldots</m> Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, <m>\ldots</m></q>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      What about negative exponents? For example, <m>y=1/x = \inverse{x}</m> represents an
      equilateral hyperbola whose axis is the line <m>y=x.</m> Can we use the
      rules of calculus to find the slope of the tangent line to this curve
      at the point <m>(x,y)?</m> If <m>y=1/x</m> then <m>xy=1.</m> Applying our current rules,
      we have
      <md>
        <mrow>\d(xy)=\d(1)</mrow>
        <mrow>x\d{y}+y\d{x}\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>x\d{y}\amp =-y\d{x}</mrow>
        <mrow>\dfdx{y}{x}\amp =-y/x</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =-1/x^2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =-1x^{-1-1},</mrow>
      </md>
      so the power rule works for <m>n=-1</m> as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we go any further with this, let's see if the answer makes
      sense geometically. Here is a graph of the
      curve <m>y=1/x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice on the graph that the tangent line at <m>(x,y)</m> is parallel to the
      tangent line at <m>(-x,-y)</m> and always has negative slope. Also, given
      the symmetry of the graph around the line <m>y=x</m> that the slope of the
      tangent line at <m>(x,1/x)</m> should be the reciprocal of the slope of the
      tangent line at <m>(1/x,x).</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify the observations made in the previous paragraph by examining <m>\dfdx{(x^{-1})}{x}.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>r</m> be positive rational number. Mimic the idea in differentiating <m>y=x^{-1}</m> to show that if <m>y=x^{-r}=1/x^r,</m> then
          <me>
            \d y=-rx^{-r-1} \d x
          </me>
          so that the power rule holds for any rational number, positive or negative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Of course, all the differentiation rules need to work in
      concert, not separately. That is, they must be applied as appropriate whenever the situation
      arises. For example
      <md>
        <mrow>\d\left(\frac{2-3x^2}{\sqrt{x}}\right)\amp =\d(\left(\frac{2}{x^{1/2}}
             -\frac{3x^2}{x^{1/2}}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\d\left(2x^{-1/2}-3x^{3/2}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =2\d\left(x^{-1/2}\right)-3\d(\left(x^{-3/2}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =2\left(-\frac12 x^{-3/2}\right)\d{x}-3\left(-3/2 x^{-5/2}\right)\d{x}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =-\left(x^{-3/2}+\frac92 x^{-5/2}\right)\d{x}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      What about <m>\d\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2-3x^2}\right)?</m> It is not so
      easy to separate as above and prompts us to derive the quotient rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      {Differentiation Rule <hash />5 (The Quotient Rule):}
      <m>\displaystyle \d\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \frac{y\d{x}-x\d{y}}{y^2}</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Derive the Quotient Rule. (Hint: <m>\frac{x}{y}=x\inverse{y}</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Applying the quotient rule to the above, we have
      <md>
        <mrow>\d\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2-3x^2}\right) \amp =\frac{(2-3x^2)\d\left(x^{1/2}\right)-x^{1/2} \d(2-3x^2)}{(2-3x^2)^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{(2-3x^2)(\frac12 x^{-1/2} )-x^{1/2} (-6x))}{(2-3x^2 )^2}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way, don't simplify things unless you have some reason to do
      so. In this problem, there is no reason to do so. If this was in
      the context of some larger problem, then it might force you to
      simplify, but it is not, so don't. But this assumes that you could
      if you had to.

  <subsection>
    <title>Some Applications</title>
    <p>
      As you might have noticed, the differentiation rules were written in
      differential form while in many of the problems you were asked to find
      slopes, which involved the quotients of differentials. You may or may
      not think that this is a big deal, but it comes down to the fact that
      in verifying the differentiation rules, it is often easier to consider
      <q>differential</q> equations of the form <m>\d y=2x \d x</m> whereas for rates of
      change (as in slope) it makes more sense to consider quotients like
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x.</m> We don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill at this
      point (wait until the foundations), but there is a slight difference
      in the two notions. In the first equation, we are equating two
      infinitely small changes. Their quotient in the second equation is a
      finite quantity. In fact, there is a name for the finite quantity
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}.</m> It is called the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and it
      represents the instantaneous rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x.</m>
      Whether you want to write <m>\d y=2x\d x</m> or <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x</m> will depend on the
      circumstances and it is really up to you. You will gain more feel for
      what is better in a given application with more experience. What you
      {cannot} do is to write <m>\d y=2x.</m> This doesn't make sense as <m>\d y</m> is
      infinitesimal and <m>2x</m> is finite.

    <p>
      To start exploiting the calculus rules we've developed, consider the
      shape of the center cable on a stable suspension bridge.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shape appears to be parabolic, but how can we be sure? To examine
      this, we will assume that the weight of the cable is negligible with
      respect to the weight of the deck (which we will assume is horizontal,
      for simplicity). Suppose the deck is made of a material that weighs <m>W</m>
      newtons per meter. Since the curve is symmetric about its lowest
      point, let's look at half of the cable. Consider a point <m>P</m> on the
      cable and all of the forces involved.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="56%" source="images/MackinacBridge2.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Here <m>H</m> represents the (magnitude of) the horizontal tension on the
      cable and is constant throughout the cable (otherwise the cable would
      move sideways), <m>Wx</m> represents the weight of the deck from the lowest
      point at <m>x=0</m> to the point <m>P,</m> (recall that we are ignoring the weight
      of the cable). <m>T</m> represents (the magnitude of) the tension on the
      cable at point <m>P</m> which is tangent to the cable at that point. For the
      cable to be stable, the vertical component of <m>T</m> must equal the weight
      of the deck and the horizontal component must equal <m>H.</m>

    <p>
      As long as we are talking about hanging cables, consider the following
      related problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) mentioned in his {Discoursi} of <m>1638</m> that
      the shape of a chain hanging under its own weight was a parabola.
      This reflected the common belief at the time. Let's explore this
      belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will apply a similar analysis as we did above concerning the cable
      on a suspension bridge. The difference is that there is no deck, and
      the vertical force will be the weight of the chain (cable) from the
      lowest point to <m>P.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we send you off to attack this problem, we need to introduce a
      topic that will take on more significance later. For now, it is more
      notational. If we have <m>y=x^3+5x-7,</m> then differentiating, we have
      <me>
        \dfdx{y}{x}=3x^2+5.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Differentiating again, we have
      <me>
        \dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)=\dfdx{(3x^2+5)}{x}=6x.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This <q>second</q> derivative is denoted by
      <me>
        \dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right) =
        \dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdx{}{x}(y)\right) = \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, we could keep going and compute the <q>third derivative</q>
      <m>\dfdxn{}{x}{3} (x^3+5x-7)
      =\dfdx{}{x}\left(\dfdxn{}{x}{2}(x^3+5x-7)\right)=\dfdx{}{x} (6x)=6.</m>

                differential equation (and so Galileo was mistaken!)  The curve
                which does satisfy it is called a catenary, which is not too
                illuminating as catenary is derived from the Latin word {catena} which
                means chain.

    </figure>

    <p>
      So, the previous problem says that the catenary is not a parabola.
      Clearly, we need to extend our differentiation rules to more
      functions. Before we do that, let's look at another application which
      we can handle at this point.
    </p>

    <p>
      To set the stage on this application, you may have learned that there
      are two types of telescopes, refractive and reflective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Refractive telescopes (top image) utilizes two lenses to refract
      light. Reflective telescopes (bottom image) utilizes a parabolic
      objective (primary) mirror to reflect light toward the focus of the
      parabola (remember Roberval) where the flat (secondary) mirror
      reflects it to the eyepiece. Large telescopes tend to be reflective
      telescopes as they really don't need the tube (which actually only
      holds the two lenses in the refractive telescope in place). As an
      example, consider the Large Binocular Telescope at Mt. Graham, AZ.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each parabolic reflector mirror is <m>8.4</m> meters in diameter. The
      following image gives you an idea of the size of one of these mirrors.
    </p>

    <p>
      How does one make such a large parabolic mirror? The Steward
      Observatory Mirror Laboratory <q>spin casts</q> these large mirrors. That
      is, they load borosilicate glass into a revolving oven. [See images
      below.]
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/SpinCasting2.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      As the glass melts and spins, the middle goes down and the sides go up
      as any liquid would. What is interesting is that the surface of the
      revolving liquid will form a parabola. We actually have the tools to
      show this, as the following problem explores.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a cylinder partially filled with a liquid which is rotating
          with an angular velocity of <m>\omega</m> radians per second. Of course, in
          such a setting the middle will go down and the sides will go up as
          in the diagram below.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <image width="37%" source="images/SpinCasting3.png" />
        </figure>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Our task is to find the shape of the surface of the liquid (that is
      the shape of the above curve which will be rotated around the <m>y</m> axis.
      If we consider a point mass <m>m</m> at point <m>(x,y)</m> on the surface, then the
      force from the liquid which keeps that point elevated is perpendicular
      to the surface. (Think about a hose with a hole in it. The water
      sprays out in a stream perpendicular to the hose.)
    </p>

    <p>
      If we separate that force into its vertical and horizontal components,
      then we get the following diagram.
      The (magnitude of) the vertical component is <m>mg,</m> where <m>g</m> is the
      acceleration due to gravity. This is the force needed to counter the
      weight of the particle. The horizontal force has a magnitude of
      <m>mx\omega^2.</m> This is the centripetal force which is keeping the
      particle moving in a circle around the axis. [We will see why this is
      the centripetal force later, but for now, take it on faith.]

            Use the above information to show that the curve must
                  satisfy the differential equation

              \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\omega^2}{g} x
            </me>
            and that the curve satisfying this must be a parabola.

            What will happen to the parabola as <m>\omega</m> increases?  Does this
                  make sense with the physical problem?

      Notice that in the problem, we furnished a formula for the centripetal
      force. Where did this come from? Again, we need to extend our
      differentiation rules to beyond polynomials.

      Recall that Fermat was able to deduce Snell's Law of Refraction by
      minimizing the amount of time it took for light to travel from point <m>A</m>
      in air to point <m>B</m> in <xref ref="FermatSnell">water</xref>. Fermat was able to do this before
      the advent of calculus, but in his paper, Leibniz applied his
      differential calculus to solve the problem. Recall
      <xref ref="FermatSnell-mbed">Problem</xref> on <xref ref="FermatSnell">page</xref> from
      <xref ref="cha_science-before-calc">Chapter</xref>.

          Consider the following labeling in the above diagram.
          Find an expression for the time <m>T</m> traveled along the path from <m>A</m>
          to <m>B</m> in terms of the variable <m>x</m> and the constants <m>a,</m> <m>b,</m> <m>c,</m> <m>v_1,</m>
          and <m>v_2.</m>

          The answer to this problem is
          <me>
            T=T(x)=\frac{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}{v_1} +\frac{\sqrt{b^2+(c-x)^2}}{v_2}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          As with Fermat, Leibniz knew that if we graphed this curve, then at
          the minimum there would be a horizontal tangent line. This says that
          we should set <m>\dfdx{T}{x}=0</m> to find this minimum. Differentiating, we get
          <me>
            \dfdx{T}{x}=\frac{1}{v_1}   \dfdx{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}{dx}+\frac{1}{v_2}
            \dfdx{\sqrt{b^2+(c-x)^2}}{x}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We've reached an impasse. We don't yet know how to differentiate the
          quantities involved. This is where Rule <hash />7 - The Chain Rule comes in.
