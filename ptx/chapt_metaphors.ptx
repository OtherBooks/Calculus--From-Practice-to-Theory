    Commercial transactions were hard to do using Roman numerals. So in
    Europe during the Middle Ages such computations were usually done
    using pebbles on a small table called a counting board. The board was
    marked off so that placing a pebble here we meant <q>one</q>, there meant
    <q>ten</q> and so on. Think of an abacus. Obviously the only skills
    needed to perform a given computation, was how to read the board and
    how to move the pebbles around on the board to perform the
    calculation. The Latin word for <q>rock</q> or <q>pebble</q> is
    <q>calculus.</q> Thus the English word <q>calculus</q> has come to refer to
    any computational scheme where it was not really necessary to
    understand the computations in order to apply them, at least for basic
    applications.

  <p>
    There are many calculuses (calculi?) in mathematics but the one we will be
    studying is of such profound and fundamental importance that it has
    come to be called <em>Calculus</em> or <em>The Calculus</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, it is a calculus in the original sense. That is, it is
    possible to simply memorize the rules for manipulating symbols
    (<q>move the pebbles</q>) and thereby solve a great many otherwise very
    difficult problems without any very deep understanding. There is
    nothing wrong with <em>using</em> Calculus this way. Indeed, this
    is precisely what it was designed for. The computational rules you
    will learn shortly, once mastered, can be used to solve quite
    substantial problems fairly easily. The difficulty is that those who
    learn Calculus in that manner are in a position similar to the
    merchants of the Middle Ages. They can do the calculations but they
    don't understand anything except how to manipulate the pebbles (use
    the notation). So, if a problem comes up that is outside the reach
    of their pebbles they are completely helpless.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was not a problem for say, Marco Polo. He rarely had to do
    much mathematics besides add, subtract, multiply and divide. A deep
    understanding of these operations is not needed for the simple
    financial transactions of the Middle Ages. However, in the modern
    era such routine, rudimentary computations are done by machines. The
    role of humans is to figure out how to apply the fundamental
    concepts in novel arenas and in novel ways. Simply learning to
    compute, without a deeper understanding of the principles involved,
    is not a foundation upon which a modern education can be built.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, you will need a profound understanding of the underlying
    principles of Calculus. An excellent way to learn these is to start
    with the computational techniques themselves. This is how we will
    begin.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is easy to mistake the rules for using the notation of Calculus
    (using the pebbles<fn>OK. We're pretty sure you understand the
        metaphor by now so we'll stop giving the parenthetical cues.</fn>)
    with the Calculus itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are not.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are simply the rules for using Calculus which can be used
    blindly, with no understanding at all.
    But this does not make them unimportant. If anything it is more
    important than ever that you learn these computational rules because
    it is through mastering the fundamentals that the underlying
    concepts emerge and become clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    This process is slow. It takes time and practice and can be
    incredibly frustrating. Prepare yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, at the other end, when it all comes together,
    there is a transcendent beauty to The Calculus which is impossible
    to convey to the uninitiated. A poet once wrote, <q>Euclid alone has
    looked on beauty bare,</q> but this is not true. Everyone who has
    studied and understood mathematics beyond the level of moving the
    pebbles has seen the same beauty that Euclid did. If you have
    never seen it, this is your chance. But you must focus on
    <em>understanding</em> not mere <em>computation</em>. It may surprise you to learn that when it was first invented the
    validity of Calculus was very suspect. Indeed, the foundations of
    the topic were so murky that the only reason Calculus remained
    viable was the simple fact that it <em>worked</em>. Or, at least,
    it seemed to. As you will soon see, many otherwise very difficult
    problems become straightforward if we know how to <q>move the pebbles</q>
    correctly.
