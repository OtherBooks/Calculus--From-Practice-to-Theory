    Early efforts to find the line tangent to a curve focussed on what
    was called the subtangent problem. That is, given a curve, <m>y,</m> as in
    this figure
    <image width="37%" source="images/subtan1.png" />
    where <m>B</m> is on the curve, <m>y,</m> <m>AB</m> is perpendicular to <m>CA</m> and <m>BC</m>
    is tangent to <m>y</m> at <m>B,</m> we'd like to find the coordinates of the
    point <m>C.</m> The line segment <m>AC</m> is called the subtangent, and finding
    the coordinates of <m>C</m> is equivalent to finding the derivative of <m>y</m>
    at <m>B.</m> This is because if <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are known then the slope of
    the line segment <m>BC</m> is the derivative of <m>y</m> at <m>B.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    As a technique the subtangent problem quickly fell out of favor with
    the invention of Calculus. However the following subtangent problem is
    instructive: We ask is there a curve with the property that it
    subtangent always has length one?
    <image width="37%" source="images/subtan2.png" />
    It is instructive because, <m>\dfdx{y}{x},</m> the derivative of <m>y</m>
    appears very naturally. If we take <m>\d y</m> to be an infinitesimal
    vertical displacement of the curve <m>y</m> at <m>B,</m> and <m>\d x</m> to be a
    horizontal displacement
    <image width="37%" source="images/subtan3.png" />
    then by proportional triangles we have <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{y}{1},</m> or
    <men xml:id="eq_ExpDiffeq" >
      \dfdx{y}{x} = y.
    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    For obvious reasons this is called a <em>differential equation.</em> In
    fact, this is the same differential equation we examined in
    <xref ref="sec_eulers-method">section</xref> so we already have an approximate
    graph of this curve. Recall that in <xref ref="sec_eulers-method">section</xref> we
    found that near the point <m>(0,1)</m> the curve looks like this:
    <image width="37%" source="images/exp-piecewise-linear.png" />
    A graphical approximation is nice but we'd really like an explicit formula.
  </p>

  <p>
    We would like to find a function, <m>f(x),</m> that satisfies
    <xref ref="eq_ExpDiffeq">equation</xref>. Nothing really obvious comes to mind as a
    solution but before we give up, let's see if we can
    guess a solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    No, really. Let's try guessing. It can be surprisingly effective. You
    know this of course. You've been doing it all of your life, but you've
    probably been discouraged from it in the past so you tend to deny
    doing it. It's ok. Guess anyway. We won't tell anyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and
    we encourage you to use it regularly. If you guess wrong, which is
    most likely, then you have this related problem to think about:
    All of your intuition said this was a good guess. Why didn't it work?
    The answer to that question almost always gives some insight into the
    original problem. Even a bad guess can be useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bad guesses are
    easy. If you don't know what else to do, make a bad guess. But all by
    itself a bad guess is a waste of time. You must also figure out why
    your bad guess doesn't work.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> But</em> the real danger in guessing <mdash /> the reason
    it is usually discouraged <mdash /> is that when you do guess correctly
    it is <em>very</em> tempting to just move on from there. <em>Don't
    do that.</em> When you guess correctly it is crucial that you take a few
    moments to ask yourself what was the intuition that lead you to that
    guess. Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But
    intuition is unconcious. If you don't stop and ask yourself why this
    seemed like a good idea your thought process will remain unconscious
    and thus nearly useless. It is just as important to understand where a good
    guess came from as it is to understand why a bad guess didn't work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stop. Take a breath. Think. Then move on.
  </p>

  <p>
    So let's take a guess. There is no need to get really, really crazy
    though. let's try this guess: <m>y = 1.</m> Obviously this won't work
    because <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is equal to zero, not one. But wait! The
    derivative of <m>x</m> is <m>1</m> so if we we guess <m>y=1+x</m> we get <m>\dfdx{y}{x}
    = 1.</m> This almost works. When we differentiate we recover the first, constant
    term (<m>1</m>) but lose the second, linear term (<m>x</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Can we adjust this last guess so as to recover the second term?
    Sure. Let's try <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}.</m> In that case <m>\dfdx{y}{x} =
    1+x</m> and again, upon differentiating we get everything back but the
    last term.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly we can pick up that term by adding <m>\frac{x^3}{3\cdot2}</m> to
    our last guess. That is, if we take
    <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3\cdot2}</m> then <m>\dfdx{y}{x} =
    1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}.</m> But again, the last missing term is a
    problem. Continuing to add terms won't help as the following problem
    shows.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Compute <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and <m>y-\dfdx{y}{x}</m> for each of the following.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>(a)</title>
            <p>
              <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(b)</title>
            <p>
              <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(c)</title>
            <p>
              <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(d)</title>
            <p>
              <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
                    \frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} + \frac{x^n}{n!}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Clearly, we've almost got something here. If we take
    <md>
      <mrow>y\amp = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
        \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} +   \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}</mrow>
      <intertext>then</intertext>
      <mrow>\dfdx{y}{x} \amp = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
        \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!},</mrow>
      <intertext>and</intertext>
      <mrow>y-\dfdx{y}{x} \amp = \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}.</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    So the difference between <m>y</m> and <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is that stupid
    one-millionth term! Surely we can handle that somehow!
  </p>

  <p>
    Sadly no. The fact is that there is no polynomial that solves the
    differential equation <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    So a fair question is, <q>Why have we led you down this wild goose
    chase?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    As we mentioned earlier differential equations can be extremely
    difficult to solve. But often in real applications an approximate
    solution is almost as good. Clearly we have an approximate solution
    here. One million is a very large number, so one million factorial
    (<m>1000000!</m>) is inconceivably large. Thus for any reasonable value of
    <m>x</m> that one millionth term, <m>\frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!},</m> is
    vanishingly small and can probably be ignored in real applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, we don't really have to take anywhere near that many
    terms. Depending on the application involved
    <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}</m> might be entirely adequate as an
    approximate solution. Indeed, for some applications the approximation
    <m>y=1+x</m> is all that is really needed. Although we haven't
    <em>solved</em> the problem we have found a very good
    approximation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there is no <em>polynomial</em> that solves
    <xref ref="eq_ExpDiffeq">equation</xref> does that mean there is no solution at
    all? Certainly not. In fact, since that last term of the polynomial
    was always the stumbling block it should be clear that all we need to
    do is <em>not have a last term</em>. That is, the solution of
    <xref ref="eq_ExpDiffeq">equation</xref> is:
    <me>
      y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
    </me>
    where the dots at the end mean that the summation goes on
    forever so there is no last term.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Differentiate
        <me>
          y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots
        </me>
        term-by-term to show that
        <me>
          \dfdx{y}{x}= y.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    At this point we have two approximate answers to the question, ``What
    curve satisfies the differential equation <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y?"</m> By Euler's
    Method we've found several approximate points on the curve and by
    trying to guess a solution we've found that a polynomial of the form
    <me>
      y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}
    </me>
    is also probably a good approximation as well. If both of those
    statements are true then the graphs should be similar. In the following
    figure we have both our Euler approximation and the graph of
    <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}.</m>
    <image width="112%" source="images/ExpEulerCubic.png" />
    As you can see they are indeed similar, at least near the point
    <m>(0,1),</m> so we can be confident that we are on the right track.
  </p>

  <p>
    A disadvantage of Euler's Method is that a great deal of effort is
    needed to find just a few (approximate) points on our curve. But now
    that we have convincing evidence that the polynomials
    <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}</m> also
    make good approximations we can use those to see what our function
    looks like farther from <m>(0,1).</m> Here is the graph of the polynomial
    <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}:</m>
    <image width="37%" source="images/CubicExpApprox.png" />
    and here is the graph of <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots
    + \frac{x^{10}}{10!}:</m>
    <image width="37%" source="images/TenthExp.png" />
  </p>

  <p>
    Do these graphs make sense to you? Stop and think about it for a
    moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our differential equation is <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y.</m> This says that
    the slope of the curve at any point is equal to its
    <m>y-</m>coordinate. Put another way, as the graph rises is will get
    steeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is the graph of <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots +
    \frac{x^{50}}{50!}.</m> You can see for yourself that this is what happens.
    <image width="37%" source="images/FiftiethExp.png" />
  </p>

  <p>
    But wait a minute! Have you seen a graph like this before?
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course you have. The graph of <m>y=10^x</m> looks very similar:
    <image width="37%" source="images/TenToTheX.png" />
    Now this is interesting. If everything we've done so far is valid the
    the solution of <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y</m> is probably something like
    <me>
      y=e^x
    </me>
    where <m>e</m> is some, currently unknown, number.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's proceed on that assumption<fn>Obviously this is actually
      true or we wouldn't have spent this much time on it.</fn>for now,
    recognizing that this is only a conjecture for now. That is, we make
    the following conjecture.
  </p>

  <conjecture>
    <p>
      There is a real number we'll denote by <m>e,</m> with the property that
      <m>e^x</m> satisfies <xref ref="eq_ExpDiffeq">equation</xref>. That is
      <me>
        \dfdx{(e^x)}{x} = e^x.
      </me>
    </p>
  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Depending on your mathematical background you may have seen this
    number before and you may already know that it is approximately
    <m>2.7128.</m> This is true but it isn't especially useful information for
    our purposes right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is useful is that we now have strong evidence that the solution
    of <xref ref="eq_ExpDiffeq">equation</xref> is <m>y=e^x,</m> and that this can be
    interpreted as an exponential function just like <m>10^x</m> or <m>2^x.</m>
    Because of this the expression <m>e^x</m> has been named the <q>natural
    exponential.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will admit that nothing seems <q>natural</q> about <m>y=e^x</m> being the
    natural exponential function. One could say that satisfying <m>dy/dx=y</m>
    makes it natural, but there is more to it than that. First, consider
    that by the chain rule, if <m>x=kt</m> for some constant <m>k,</m> then
    <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=\dfdx{e^kt}{t}=\dfdx{e^x}{x}\dfdx{x}{t}=e^x\cdot{}k=ky.</m>
    If we interpret <m>t</m> as time, then this says that the quantity
    <m>y=y(t)=e^kt</m> grows at a rate proportional to the amount present. In
    here, the constant <m>k</m> is called the <q>relative (nominal) growth
    rate.</q> The name makes sense if you notice that
    <m>k=\frac{\dfdx{y}{t}}{y}=\frac {\frac{\d{y}}{y}}{t},</m> and often this
    growth rate is stated as a percentage. Consider the following
    example.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose a strain of bacteria, under controlled conditions, grows
        continuously with a relative growth rate of 5<percent /> per hour. If we
        start with <m>2</m> grams of this bacteria, how much would we have in <m>4</m>
        hours?
      </p>

      <p>
        If we let <m>B</m> represent the amount of bacteria (in grams) at
        time <m>t</m> hours, then we have that this must satisfy
        <me>
          \dfdx{B}{t}=.05 B, \ \     B(0)=2.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can check that <m>B=Ce^.05t</m> will satisfy this differential
        equation for any arbitrary constant <m>C.</m> To find <m>C,</m> we will utilize
        the initial condition <m>B(0)=2.</m> Substituting <m>t=0,</m> and <m>B=2</m> into our
        equation <m>B=Ce^kt</m> we get
        <me>
          2=Ce^{.05\cdot0}=C\cdot1=C
        </me>
        and so the amount of bacteria at any time is given by <m>B=2e^.05t</m>
        and after <m>4</m> hours we have <m>B(4)=2e^{.05\cdot4}\approx 2.44</m> grams. Notice that
        after <m>400</m> hours, the model predicts that we would have
        <m>B(400)=2e^{.05\cdot400}\approx 970330390.8</m> grams. This illustrates the
        notion that something growing exponentially grows really fast, and
        that our model is not a good predictor for large values of <m>t.</m>
        This limitation makes sense as the bacteria could not sustain a
        growth rate of <m>5</m><percent /> indefinitely. There are modifications to this
        model which we will explore later to take this into account, but
        for now we will utilize this exponential growth within reason.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    We will explore some more examples of exponential growth models.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that any investment grows continuously at a nominal rate of
        <m>7</m><percent /> per year. What would be the effective yield of this
        investment? That is, how much would the investment actually pay in
        one year?
      </p>

      <p>
        Solution: Let <m>A=A(t)</m> denote the value of the investment (in dollars)
        at time <m>t</m> years and let <m>A_0</m> denote the initial amount. Then we have
        that <m>A</m> must satisfy
        <me>
          \dfdx{A}{t}=.07A,\ \  A(0)=A_0
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, as before, we have <m>A(t)=A_0e^.07t.</m> Thus in one year, the
        investment is worth <m>A(1)=A_0e^.07\approx 1.0725A_0.</m> Thus, our annual
        yield is actually <m>1.0725A_0-A_0=.0725A_0</m> which represents and
        effective yield of <m>7.25</m><percent /> as opposed to a nominal rate of <m>7</m><percent />.
      </p>

      <p>
        \-\marginpar{  Bud, we could put some of these at the end of the section on
        logarithms, including some standard exponential growth and decay,
        Newton's law of cooling.}
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, the relative (nominal) rate is not always given so neatly
        and often we need to glean it from the information given. To do
        this, we will need to look at the inverse of the natural exponential
        function, namely the natural logarithm function. But before we do
        this, we will utilize our new-found friend to settle the matter of
        the catenary.
