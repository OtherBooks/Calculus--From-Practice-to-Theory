    <title>Exponential Development</title>
    <p>
      We'd like to find <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x,</m> (denoted <m>y(x),</m>) which
      has the property that \-\marginpar{ Unclear.}
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x} =y.</m> As posed this problem is similar to asking for a
      solution of the algebraic equation <m>3y-2x=0</m> because there are, in
      fact, many solutions. Put another way, there is no
      <em>unique</em> solution. For example, <m>(3,2),</m> <m>(6,4),</m> and <m>(12,8)</m>
      are all solutions of <m>3y-2x=0</m>. If we add another constraint, for
      example,
      <m>8y-5x=1</m> then there is a unique solution. (Find it.).
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to add another constraint to this problem in
      order to have a unique solution. We'll add this one<fn>This
        question of when unique solutions exist is deep and complex. We will not
        address it now because it is not important at the moment.</fn>: When <m>x=0,</m>
      <m>y=1.</m> What can we find out about the graph of this function?
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we start try to imagine what the graph of <m>y(x)</m> would look
      like. Notice that the statement <m>\dfdx{y}{x} =y</m> says that the slope
      of the graph, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is exactly the same as the <m>y</m>
      coordinate. So when <m>y(x)</m> is very small then the tangent line is
      nearly horizontal. When <m>y(x)</m> very large then the tangent line is
      nearly vertical.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keeping this in mind, we ask what happens if <m>y(x)</m> is exactly equal
      to zero for some value of <m>x?</m> That is, if there is a number, <m>b</m> such
      that <m>y(b) = 0</m> what does this tell us about <m>y(x)?</m> To find out
      suppose that <m>t\lt b</m> and that <m>y(t) >0.</m> This situation is
      pictured in the following sketch:
      <image width="37%" source="images/ExpFunc1.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait! What we have drawn in this sketch is impossible! Do you see why?
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly the slope of the tangent line drawn at the point
      <m>(t_1,y(t_1))</m> is negative. But <m>y(t_1)>0</m> and
      <me>
        \left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=t_1} = y(t_1) > 0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=t_1} >0</m> and
      <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=t_1} \lt 0.</m> But a number cannot be both
      positive <em>and</em> negative, so our original assumption, that
      <m>y(t_1)>0</m> must be wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore it must be true that <m>y(t_1)\leq 0.</m>
      <index><main>Proof by contradiction</main></index>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Actually we haven't been completely honest with you in the arguments
          above. Specifically, in the first diagram it will not necessarily be
          true that the graph of <m>y(x)</m> passes through the point
          <m>(t_1, y(t_1))</m> with a negative slope. Nevertheless, there will
          always be a point to the left of <m>b</m> where the slope of the
          tangent line will be negative. Convince yourself of this and give a
          written explanation. Make it as clear as you can.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      But <m>y(t_1)</m> cannot be strictly less than zero either. You can
      convince yourself of this by using essentially the same argument as
      above and the following sketch:
      <image width="37%" source="images/ExpFunc2.png" />
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Modify the argument above and use the previous sketch to show that
          <m>y(t_1)\geq0.</m> Again, this sketch does not capture all of the
          possibilities in that there is no <em>a priori</em> reason to believe
          that the slope of the tangent line will be positive. However, as in
          the previous problem there will always be a point to the left of <m>b</m>
          where the slope of the tangent line is positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      The only possible conclusion then, is that <m>y(t_1)=0</m> for every
      <m>t_1\lt b.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus we have the following lemma:
    </p>

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y</m> and <m>y(b)=0</m> for any real number <m>b,</m> then <m>y(x)
            = 0</m> for every <m>x\lt b.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>

    <p>
      This is interesting. Even more interesting is the fact that when <m>x>b</m>
      it remains true that <m>y(x)=0.</m> To see this consider the following
      sketch:
      <image width="56%" source="images/ExpFunc3.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      In our sketch <m>y(b)=0</m> so <m>y(x)=0</m> for all <m>x\lt b</m> by our argument
      above. But to the right of <m>b</m> either <m>y(x)\geq0</m> or <m>y(x)\leq0.</m> In
      our sketch we have assumed that <m>y(x)\ge0.</m> Look closely at the
      tangent line of <m>y(x)</m> at the point <m>x</m> and at that secant line
      between the points <m>(b,0)</m> and <m>(x,y(x).</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular consider the slopes of these two lines. The slope of the
      tangent line will be <m>\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=x_0}</m> since that's what the derivative
      is. But since <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y(x)</m> the slope of the tangent line at <m>x</m>
      will be <m>y(x).</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Also it is clear from the sketch that the slope of the secant is
      <m>\frac{y(x)}{x-b}</m> and that <m>\frac{y(x)}{x-b} \lt  \dfdx{y}{x} = y(x).</m>
      So
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{y(x)}{x-b} \amp \lt   y(x).</mrow>
        <intertext>Since <m>y(x)\neq0</m> we can divide by it so</intertext>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{x-b} \amp \lt   1.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This last statement is impossible, but at first glance it may not be
      obvious why. The only constraint we put on <m>x</m> is that <m>x>b.</m> That
      means that <m>x</m> can be <em>any</em> number greater than <m>b</m> and it must
      still be true that <m>\frac{1}{x-b}\lt 1.</m> Put this way it is a little more
      clear that this can't be true. Suppose for example that <m>x=b+1/2.</m>
      Then we get <m>2\lt 1</m> which is certainly not true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this line of reasoning leads to impossible
      conclusions<index><main>Proof by contradiction</main></index> it must be that our
      initial assumption that is wrong. Therefore <m>y(x)</m> is not positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      A similar argument will show that <m>y(x)</m> is not negative. Thus the
      only conclusion is that <m>y(x)=0</m> and as before this is true for all
      numbers to the right of <m>b.</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>y(x)</m> is not negative when <m>x>b.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      The question we've been addressing is, ``If <m>y(b)=0</m> for any number
      <m>b</m> what can we tell about the function, <m>y(x)?</m> Based on the
      arguments we've just seen the answer seems to be that if <m>y(x)</m> is
      <em>ever</em> zero then it is <em>always</em> zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Does this mean that <m>y(x)</m> is constantly zero? If so that would be
      very disappointing. But this isn't really what we've seen. Look
      carefully at the statement, <q>If <m>y(x)</m> is <em>ever</em> zero then it is
      <em>always</em> zero.</q> Another way<index><main>Contrapositive</main></index> to
      say the same thing is <q>If <m>y(x)</m> is not zero <em>somewhere</em>, then
      it is not zero <em>anywhere</em>.</q> That is, if <m>y(x)</m> is positive
      anywhere it must be positive everywhere. This is because if it is
      positive in one place and negative in another then it must be zero in
      between. But that isn't possible since we've just shown that <m>y(x)</m> is
      zero anywhere then it is zero everywhere. Similarly if <m>y(x)</m> is
      negative anywhere then it is negative everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      This will be important later so we formalize the results of this
      discussion as a theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_zero-exp">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>y(x)</m> is a function which satisfies the differential equation
          <men xml:id="eq_exp-diffeq" >
            \dfdx{y}{x} = y,
          </men>
          then one of the following statements is true:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>y(x)</m> is always positive,
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>y(x)</m> is always negative, or
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>y(x)</m> is always zero.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      This result took a long time to get and our reasoning was fairly
      subtle. The next result is a little simpler so we will simply state it
      as a theorem and prove it.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_exp-multiple">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>y(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> both satisfy <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref>, and
          that <m>g(x)\neq0.</m> Then <m>y(x) = c\cdot g(x)</m> for some constant <m>c.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        This follows immediately from the
        Quotient Rule as follows.
        Taking the derivative of the quotient <m>y(x)/g(x)</m> we have:
        <md>
          <mrow>\dfdx{\left(\frac{y(x)}{g(x)}\right)}{x} \amp =
                                  \frac{g(x)\dfdx{y}{x}-y(x)\dfdx{g}{x}}{\left[g(x)\right]^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac{g(x)y(x)-y(x)g(x)}{\left[g(x)\right]^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =0.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        From <xref ref="thm_zero-exp">theorem</xref> we see that
        <m>\dfdx{\left(\frac{y(x)}{g(x)}\right)}{x}=0.</m> So from
        <xref ref="thm_ConstantDifferential">theorem</xref> we have
        <m>\frac{y(x)}{g(x)}</m> is a constant. Call that constant <m>c</m> so that
        <me>
          y(x) = c\cdot g(x).
        </me>
      </p>
    </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_exp-add-prop">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> is a real number and <m>y(x)</m> satisfes <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref>, then
          <m>y(x+a)=y(x)\cdot y(a).</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        From <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref> we see that
        <me>
          \dfdx{y}{x}(x+a) = y(x+a),
        </me>
        so by <xref ref="thm_exp-multiple">theorem</xref> we have
        <me>
          y(x+a) = c\cdot y(a).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        This must be true for any value of <m>a</m> so we can find <m>c</m> by simply
        taking <m>a=0.</m> In that case
        <md>
          <mrow>y(x) \amp = c\cdot y(0),</mrow>
          <intertext>but since <m>y(0)=1,</m> again by <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref>
                 we have</intertext>
          <mrow>y(x) \amp = c</mrow>
        </md>
        so that
        <me>
          y(x+a) = y(x)\cdot y(a).
        </me>
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      At this point we will pause to clean up our notation a bit. The
      property
      <me>
        y(x+a) = y(x)\cdot y(a).
      </me>
      is very familiar. The function <m>f(x) = 2^x</m> has this property since
      <m>f(x+a) = 2^{x+a} = 2^x\cdot2^a = f(x)\cdot f(a),</m> as does <m>3^x,</m> or
      <m>5^x</m> In fact, any function of the form <m>g(x) = a^x</m> where <m>a>0</m> has
      this property. Such a function is called an <em>exponential
      function.</em> The <em>natural exponential</em> is <em>defined</em> to be
      the function
      <me>
        \text{ exp } (x) = e^x
      </me>
      where the number <m>e</m> is chosen so that <m>\text{ exp } (x)</m> satisfies the
      conditions <m>y(0) = 1</m> from <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref>. That is
      <md>
        <mrow>\dfdx{(\text{ exp } )}{x} \amp = \text{ exp } (x).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we take <m>y=e^x</m> then <m>y(x)</m> satisfies the differential
      <xref ref="eq_exp-diffeq">equation</xref> by definition.
