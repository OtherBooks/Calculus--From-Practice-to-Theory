  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the <q>learned giants</q> that Newton and Leibniz referred to was
      Galileo Galilei (1564-1642).
    </p>

    <p>
      Galileo was interested in questions like these: Suppose you throw a
      ball straight up into the air with an initial velocity of <m>15</m>
      meters per second. How high will the ball go? How long will it take
      for it to hit the ground? What will its velocity be at impact? If
      you throw the ball up with twice as much initial velocity will it go
      twice as high?
    </p>

    <p>
      We will spend some time examining how Calculus is used to describe the
      motion of objects. If physics isn't your particular interest be
      assured that this is only a starting point. Calculus is applicable to
      the real world far beyond physics. However it was first invented as a
      way to describe motion, and the language of Calculus reflects
      this. Moreover, motion will serve as the foundational metaphor for
      many of the other applications so it is well worth out time to
      understand this fundamental problem very well before proceeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, an object falling freely under the influence of Earth's
      gravity gets moving pretty quickly so it's speed can be hard to
      measure and the tools for measuring time in Galileo's day were limited
      to say the least. He slowed things down by letting small balls roll
      down a ramp assuming, correctly, that friction with the ramp would not
      significantly influence his measurements or computations. He noticed
      that the balls always accelerated at a constant rate which depended on
      the steepness the ramp. That is, the ball's velocity increased at a
      constant rate. More precisely, the acceleration of the rolling ball varied with the
      angle <m>\theta,</m> as in this diagram.

      \end{wraptable}
      When <m>\theta=\pi/2</m> clearly the ball doesn't move so its acceleration
      is zero. When <m>\theta=0</m> the ball accelerates freely under the
      influence of gravity. Galileo measured the acceleration associated
      with steeper and steeper ramps (that is for <m>\theta</m> closer and closer
      to zero) obtaining a table of values for similar to the one at the right.
      From this table it is clear that as <m>\theta</m> gets closer and closer to
      zero the acceleration is getting closer and closer to <m>9.8.</m> Thus
      Galileo deduced that when there is no ramp (when
      <m>\theta =0</m>) the <em>velocity</em> will increase each second by <m>9.8\,
      m/s.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, the <em>acceleration</em> of an object falling under the
      influence of the earth's gravity is <m>9.8</m> meters per second each
      second. This is usually abbreviated as <m>9.8\,m/s^2.</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Actually, Galileo wouldn't have made that many measurements. Instead
          he would have made one measurement very carefully and deduced the
          vertical acceleration, <m>g=9.8 m/s^2,</m> from that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use the first line of the table above and the following diagram, and
          the knowledge that <m>\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)=\frac12</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          \InsertGraphic
          to deduce that <m>g=9.8.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      This means that as an object falls its <em>velocity</em> increases at the
      constant rate of <m>9.8\, m/s</m> every second so we have <m>v=9.8t.</m> If we
      drop the ball from some height, then initially its initial velocity is
      zero. It is not moving. After one second it will be falling at a rate
      of <m>9.8\,m/s,</m> after two seconds, its speed will be
      <m>9.8\times2=19.6\,m/s,</m> etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, if the ball's <em>velocity</em> in meters per second
      (<m>m/s</m>) is changing at a constant rate, say <m>r</m> meters per second, per
      second (<m>m/s^2</m>) and <m>t</m> is the number of elapsed seconds then
      <me>
        v=rt.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can verify that this is correct<fn>Or nearly so.</fn>by looking
      at the units of measurement. Since the acceleration, <m>r,</m> is measured
      in <m>m/s^2</m> and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds when they are multiplied the
      obvious symbolic cancellation gives
      <me>
        m/s^2\cdot s = m/s
      </me>
      or meters per second, which are the units of measurement of velocity
      as they should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course the specific value of <m>9.8\,m/s</m> is an artifact of the units
      we've chosen to measure distance (meters) and the fact that we are on
      the surface of a particular planet. If we measure distance in feet
      instead then a falling object will accelerate at <m>32 ft/s^2.</m> If we
      are on the surface of the moon it will accelerate at <m>1.6\, m/s.</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if we measure distance in feet the acceleration constant
          on the moon is <m>5.2 m/s^2.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_simpl-case_-dropp">
    <title>The Simplest Case: A Dropped Ball</title>
    <p>
      To begin we will only consider the case of an object falling
      vertically under the influence of gravity. Suppose we drop a ball
      from a height of <m>9.8</m> meters. Will it hit the ground at the end of
      that first second?
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly not. To reach the ground after <m>1</m> second the ball would have
      to average <m>9.8\,m/s</m> during the entirety of that first second. But at
      first it is not moving at all (velocity <m>=0</m>). After one second its
      velocity has increased to <m>9.8 m/s.</m> So for the entire duration of
      that first second the ball's <em>average</em> velocity is <em>less
      than</em> <m>9.8 m/s.</m> So it has not yet hit the ground. But exactly how
      far it has fallen is not yet clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reasoning similarly, at the beginning of the next second the ball is
      already falling at <m>9.8\,m/s</m> and thereafter it increases, so it falls
      <em>at least</em> <m>9.8</m> meters during the next second. So, while we
      cannot yet tell <em>exactly</em> how far it falls during either second,
      we can say that it will hit the ground some time during the second
      second<fn>How the word <q>second</q> came to have two such
        different meanings is interesting. Google it.</fn></p>

    <p>
      But how can we find out exactly when the ball strikes the ground?
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly, the formula <m>v=rt</m> which tells us the ball's velocity at any
      time <m>t</m> is not sufficient. But if we had a similar expression for
      <m>p,</m> the ball's position at any time <m>t</m> we would be in much better
      shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      \begin{mynotation}{Function}
      Since <m>p</m> and <m>t</m> are the quantities of interest, and <m>p</m> depends on
      <m>t</m> we will use the functional notation, <m>p(t)</m> to represent all of
      this succinctly. This is just a shorter way to indicat that
      position <m>p,</m> depends on the elapsed time <m>t.</m>
      \end{mynotation}
      Now suppose we know that the graph of <m>p(t)</m> looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/GenericVelocity.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not suggesting that the graph above actually is the graph of
      <m>p(t).</m> After all, if we knew that our problem would be solved.
      But suppose it is. Can we tell from this
      what the velocity, <m>v(t),</m> will be at a given time, <m>t?</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure we can.
    </p>

    <p>
      All we need are the differentials that we introduced in
      <xref ref="chapt_differentials">Chapter</xref>. That is, if <m>p(t)</m> is the ball's
      position at time <m>t,</m> and we allow time to tick forward by an
      infinitesimal amount, <m>\d{t}</m> then we have the following picture:
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/GenericVelocityWithDiffTri.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      We know from our work in <xref ref="chapt_differentials">Chapter</xref> that
      <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> is the derivative of <m>p(t).</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover <m>\d{p}</m> is measured in meters while <m>\d{t}</m> is measured in
      seconds so <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> is measured in meters per second. The obvious
      conclusion is that if <m>p(t)</m> gives the position of the ball then
      <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> is it's velocity.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use an argument analogous to this to show that the derivative of
          velocity is acceleration.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Our problem of course is exactly the reverse of this. We have the
      velocity
      <me>
        v(t) = 9.8 t = \dfdx{p}{t}
      </me>
      and we need to construct the position function, <m>p(t).</m> This might seem
      a little daunting at first but it really isn't too bad. We need only
      ask ourselves what <m>v(t) = 9.8t</m> is the derivative of? Clearly it is
      <me>
        p(t) = \frac{9.8}{2}t^2=4.9t^2
      </me>
      since
      <me>
        \dfdx{4.9t^2}{t}=2(4.9)t=9.8t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So we can now solve our problem, right? All we have to do is find the
      time, <m>t,</m> when our position <m>p(t),</m> is zero. That is, we solve
      <md>
        <mrow>p(t)\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>4.9t^2\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>t^2\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>t\amp =0.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      So the ball reaches the ground after zero seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      <sc>Wait!</sc> That can't be right.
    </p>

    <p>
      At zero seconds we've just released the ball <m>9.8</m> meters above the
      ground so our position at <m>t=0,</m> <m>p(0)</m> should be <m>9.8</m> not zero. And
      <m>p(t)</m> should be zero for some <em>positive</em> value of <m>t,</m> since
      the ball strikes the ground some time <em>after</em> we drop it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something seems to have gone terribly wrong with our analysis of the
      problem<fn>Most likely you already see what's gone wrong. If so,
      good for you! If not, no big deal. Keep reading.</fn>. What could it be?
    </p>

    <p>
      There really isn't anything wrong with our <em>reasoning.</em> The
      difficulty is with some <em>assumptions</em> we made that we weren't
      really aware of as we worked through the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, we concluded that the ball's position is given by
      <m>p(t)=4.9t^2.</m> This is actually true but we need to remember that
      position is always given as a distance from somewhere else, some other
      location. In this case since at <m>t=0</m> we have <m>p(0)=0,</m> our <m>p(t)</m>
      gives us the distance from our starting position. Thus when we solved
      <m>p(t)=0</m> what we found was how long it takes for the ball to reach its
      starting position. Since it is already there, naturally this is <m>t=0</m>
      seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apparently what we need to solve is <m>p(t)=9.8.</m> This will tell us how
      long it takes the ball to travel the <m>9.8</m> meters to the
      ground. Solving this gives
      <md>
        <mrow>p(t) \amp = 9.8</mrow>
        <mrow>4.9t^2\amp =9.8</mrow>
        <mrow>t^2\amp =2</mrow>
        <mrow>t\amp =\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414</mrow>
      </md>
      or slightly less than one and a half seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Coordinate Systems</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is tempting to leave things there, but this problem of implicit
      assumptions <mdash /> assumption we are not aware we are making <mdash /> is a
      difficulty that will come back over and over again, sometimes in much
      more complex situations so we will take a few pages to understand it
      now in this much simpler context.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we observed that the velocity <m>v(t),</m> is the derivative of
      position, <m>p(t),</m> we asked what <m>9.8t</m> is the derivative of. The
      answer we found was <m>p(t) =4.9t^2.</m> But this is only one
      possibility. The derivative of <m>4.9t^2+5</m> is also <m>9.8t;</m> and of
      <m>4.9t^2+12;</m> and of <m>4.9t^2-700;</m> and in particular the deriviative
      of <m>4.9t^2+9.8</m> is also <m>9.8t.</m> In fact if <m>k</m> is any constant
      whatsoever then the derivative of <m>4.9t^2+k</m> is still <m>9.8t.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      When we chose <m>p(t)=4.9t^2</m> as our position function we implicitly
      assumed that our constant was zero. However we could have chosen <m>k</m>
      to be any constant whatsoever. All that changes is what distance is being measured.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="18%" source="images/FallingBall1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      For example either <m>p_1(t) =4.9t^2</m> or <m>p_2(t)=4.9t^2-9.8</m> will work
      as a position function. What is the difference between them?
    </p>

    <p>
      If we use <m>p_1(t) = 4.9t^2</m> we are assuming that at time <m>t=0</m> our
      position is also zero. Physically we have the following situation:
    </p>

    <p>
      where at <m>p(0) =0</m> and <m>p(\sqrt{2}=9.8.</m> We have
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="18%" source="images/FallingBall2.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      implicitly assumed that at time zero our starting position is also
      zero. After releasing the ball time moves forward as usual so <m>t</m>
      increases through positive numbers, and since <m>p(t)</m> measures the
      distance from our starting point, it also increases through positive
      numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if we use <m>p_2(t)=4.9t^2-9.8</m> to measure distance
      then
      we have implicitly assumed that our starting position (<m>t=0</m>) is
      at <m>-9.8</m> meters, that is <m>9.8</m> meters above the ground, so that
      <m>p_2(t)</m> measures how far the ball is away from the ground.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If other values of <m>k</m> are used then the starting position (position
          when <m>t=0</m>) and ending position (position when <m>t=\sqrt{2}</m>) of the
          ball are implicitly changed, but the falling time will not. Find the
          position function for each of the following values of <m>k.</m> Also give
          a sketch like the two above for each value of <m>k,</m> and show that in
          every case the falling time is <m>\sqrt{2}.</m>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Which of these seems to you like the best choice<fn>There is
              no correct answer to this question. That is the point.</fn>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      In either case, we are asking how long it takes the ball to fall <m>9.8</m>
      meters. In the first case we are asking how long it takes the ball
      to move <m>9.8</m> meters <em>from</em> the starting position. In the
      second we are asking how long it takes to move <em>to</em> the
      ending position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The former probably feels more natural. This is because we habitually
      measure our position in the future by assigning it a value (in meters)
      which tells us how far we have moved from our starting position. We do
      this every when we tell a friend something like, <q>You're about
      five miles away from me.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      But just because this is a common habit of mind does not mean that it
      is necessarily <em>always</em> the best way to measure position.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, one consequence of this for our current problem is that
      the ball falls in the <em>positive</em> direction. This is true whether
      we use <m>p_1(t)</m> or <m>p_2(t)</m> In the former case is that as <m>t</m>
      increases the position, <m>p_1(t),</m> changes from zero to <m>9.8</m> meters <mdash /> it becomes
      <q>more positive.</q> In the latter it also becomes more positive but in
      this case <m>p_2(t)</m> changes from <m>-9.8</m> to zero meters<fn>Perhaps
      we should call this <q>less negative?</q></fn>. In either case the position
      now is represented by a number that is greater than the position
      previously, so the positive direction is <em>downward</em> when we use
      either <m>p_1(t)</m> or <m>p_2(t).</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We don't normally think of down as positive. Find a new position
          function <m>p_3(t)</m> which models the same falling ball but has down as
          the negative direction. There is more than one way to do this so
          verify that you have a valid function by solving for the time needed
          to reach the ground. You should still get <m>\sqrt{2}.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Ultimately what this all comes down to is choosing a coordinate system
      to work in. You are used to thinking of coordinates as an ordered pair
      of numbers <m>(x,y),</m> that specify a location in the plane. But you were
      using a coordinate system long before you started graphing equations
      in the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing a coordinate system is nothing more or less than choosing a
      distinguished point as a reference from which the location of all
      other points is measured. So as soon as you were taught to think of
      the real numbers <q>as points strung out on a line</q> you were using a
      coordinate system. The point at zero is specified (and called the
      origin) and all other points are named (<m>1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>) according
      to how far they are from the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is what we did when we chose the <em>k</em>onstant above. When we
      chose <m>k=0</m> so that <m>p(t)=4.9t^2</m> we placed the origin at <m>9.8</m> meters
      above the surface of the earth. When we chose <m>k=-9.8</m> so that
      <m>p(t)=4.9t^2-9.8</m> we placed the origin at the surface of the
      earth. But of course neither gravity nor the ball care what coordinate
      system we use so it falls to the ground in <m>\sqrt{2}</m> seconds no
      matter where we decide to place the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first case since <m>p(t)=4.9t^2</m> we see that <m>p(0) = 0</m> and
      <m>p(\sqrt{2}) = 9.8</m> so the ball moved from <m>0</m> to <m>9.8</m> meters. It
      follows that <q>down</q> must be the positive direction and <q>up</q> the
      negative direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly if we use <m>p(t)=4.9t^2-9.8</m> we see that <m>p(0) = -9.8</m> and
      <m>p(\sqrt{2}) = 0.</m> Although the position of the ball is always
      negative, it moves from a more negative position, <m>-9.8,</m> to a
      non-negative position, <m>0.</m> So again <q>down</q> must be the positive and
      <q>up</q> the negative direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This seems natural when we think about a falling ball, but of course
      when we choose a coordinate system we get to choose both the origin
      and the directionality. In the next section it will be more natural
      to take <q>up</q> as the positive direction.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_tossed-ball">
    <title>A Tossed Ball: How High Will the Ball Go?</title>
    <p>
      Instead of simply dropping the ball suppose we toss it vertically
      upwards with some initial velocity of say <m>15 m/s.</m> Then after one
      second it will have <em>lost</em> <m>9.8 m/s</m> of its initial
      velocity. That is, its velocity after <m>1</m> second will be
      <m>15-9.8=5.02\,m/s.</m> After <m>2</m> seconds, its velocity will be
      <m>15-9.8\times{}2=-4.58 m/s.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, after <m>t</m> seconds its velocity will be <m>15-9.8t\, m/s.</m>
      Notice that the velocity is positive at the one second mark <m>(t=1)</m>
      and negative at the two second mark <m>(t=2.)</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      As we observed at the end of the last section, it thus seems natural
      to interpret <em>positive</em> velocity as climbing (moving in the
      positive direction). We'll need to keep this in mind as we proceed.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the height of the ball increases until the velocity drops to
      zero. At that time the ball's height has reached its zenith. After
      that the ball will continue to drop. But now its velocity will become
      larger in the negative direction (because the ball is falling, or
      moving in the negative direction), Although we don't know exactly what
      the height is at any given time we can see that there is a point where
      the ball reaches its zenith. The ball's height increases (velocity is
      positive) until it reaches its zenith and then decreases (velocity is
      negative) thereafter. The zenith occurs when the velocity has
      decreased to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we know that the velocity is positive at one second and negative
      at two seconds we can say that the ball must reach its zenith at
      somewhere between <m>1</m> second and <m>2</m> seconds after it is released.
      To find out the exact time, notice that this is precisely when the
      velocity equal to zero because for an instant at the top of its climb
      the ball's velocity is zero. Solving for <m>t</m> gives:
      <md>
        <mrow>15-9.8 t\amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>t=15/9.8\amp \approx 1.53</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the zenith is reached after approximately <m>1.53</m> seconds.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the initial velocity is double what it was originally.
          Would it take twice as long for the ball to reach its maximum
          height? What if the initial velocity was half?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      So far, so good. But now we ask: How high will the ball go?
    </p>

    <p>
      As before what we need is not the velocity function, <m>v(t) =15-9.8t,</m>
      but the position function, <m>p(t).</m> Since we know how long it takes to
      reach the maximum height (<m>\approx 1.53</m> seconds) all we need to do is
      compute <m>p(1.53).</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we know that position is the derivative of velocity all we need
      to do is ask ourselves; What is <m>v(t) = 15-9.8t</m> the derivative of?
      Give this a few moment's thought before reading on. See if you can
      figure it out for yourself. We'll wait.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear that the position function is: <m>p(t) = 15t-4.9t^2.</m>
      Is it?
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait a moment. Remember the trouble we had before with the
      konstant, <m>k?</m> Let's think about this a bit more. The derivative of
      <me>
        p(t) = 15t-4.9t^2 +k
      </me>
      is
      <me>
        v(t) =15-9.8t
      </me>
      no matter what the numerical value of <m>k</m> is, so let's see if we can
      find the value of <m>k</m> that makes things easiest for
      us. If<fn>Notice that we've rearranged the order of the
        terms. This isn't really necessary, but it's a good idea to always
        write polynomial in the standard form, unless there is a compelling
        reason not to. This makes things easier to read when you come back
        looking for the errors that will inevitably happen.</fn><m>p(t) =
      -4.9t^2+15t +k</m> then at time <m>t=0</m> the ball's position is <m>p(0) =
      -4.9(0)^2+15(0) +k = k.</m> Since we're standing on the ground when we
      toss our ball we'll probably release the ball about <m>5</m> feet above the
      ground<fn>Both authors are over six feet tall. If you are much
        taller or much shorter you should adjust this number as
        appropriate.</fn>, or about <m>1\frac{2}{3} = 5/3</m> meters. So it seems to
      make sense to set <m>k=5/3.</m> Thus our position function is:
      <me>
        p(t) = -4.9t^2+15t +  5/3
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore the maximum height of the ball is approximately <m>p(1.53) =
      -4.9(1.53)^2+15(1.53) +  5/4 \approx 13.15</m> meters.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose you toss the ball twice as hard so that its initial velocity

      We now have everything we need to describe the motion of a ball thrown
      vertically. We know the following facts:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of the position <m>p(t),</m> is the velocity <m>v(t).</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of the velocity <m>v(t),</m> is the acceleration.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            At the surface of the earth the acceleration due to gravity is
              <m>9.8\,m/s^2.</m> To keep our analysis as general as possible we will
              just say that the acceleration is a constant and us <m>\alpha</m> to
              represent it.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      First, to find the velocity function <m>v(t),</m> we ask, what is the
      constant <m>\alpha</m> is the derivative of? Clearly this is
      <me>
        v(t) =\alpha t+ v_0
      </me>
      where <m>v_0</m> is an unknown constant. To determine the value of <m>v_0</m>
      we evaluate the velocity when <m>t=0.</m> Since
      <me>
        v(0) = \alpha\cdot0+v_0 = v_0
      </me>
      we see that <m>v_0</m> is the <em>initial velocity</em> of the ball;
      its velocity just as it is released.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we ask what is
      <me>
        v(t) = \alpha t+v_0
      </me>
      the derivative of? Clearly this is
      <me>
        p(t) = \frac{\alpha}{2}t^2+v_0t+p_0
      </me>
      where <m>p_0</m> is the <em>initial position</em> by a similar argument.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we toss a ball upward from the ground with an initial velocity
      of <m>15\,m/s.</m> Then if we place the origin at ground level, and the
      position function is given by:
      <me>
        p(t) = 5/3 + 15t-4.9t^2,
      </me>
      and its graph is shown at the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we go on take a moment to notice that this is <em>not</em>
      the graph of the ball's trajectory. Remember the ball is moving
      straight up and down. Rather this graph represents a fairly abstract
      representation of the purely vertical motion of the ball. Notice that
      the horizontal axis of this graph represents <m>t,</m> the elapsed time.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is if we start our clock at the moment the ball leves our hands
      then at time <m>t=0</m> we have <m>p(0)=5/3.</m> so the point <m>(0,5/3)</m>
      represents the fact that when we start our clock the ball is <m>5/3</m>
      meters above ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, as we observed previously sin in this graph the vertical is
      measured in meters and the horizontal in seconds, it should be clear
      that the slope of <m>p(t)</m> at <m>t=0</m> is the velocity at <m>t=0.</m> That is,
      <me>
        \left.\dfdx{p}{t}\right|_{t=0} = \left.v\right|_{t=0} = 15-9.8(0)^2= 15
        \text{ meters. }
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our point is that although this graph contains a great deal of
      information about the ball's motion it is <em>not</em> a picture of
      the ball's <em>actual path</em> through the air if it is thrown
      vertically. Recall that the ball moves vertically upward from our
      hands and then vertically downward to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      However we all know that it is nearly impossible to toss a ball
      perfectly vertically. Inevitably the ball will receive some non-zero
      lateral (horizontal) velocity. When that happens the path the ball
      follows will indeed look very much like the previousl graph. This can
      lead to confusion so it is worth taking a few moments to clarify this
      a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we were to releast the ball in such a way that its initial
      <em>vertical</em> velocity is <m>15 m/s</m> as before, but also with an
      initial <em>horizontal</em> velocity of <m>1 m/s</m> then the path the
      ball follows looks exactly like the previous graph:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/FallingBallPath1.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      <em>except</em> for the labelling on the axes. Notice that the
      horizontal axis shown is labelled <q><m>x</m></q> and the vertical is
      <q><m>y.</m></q> This is because the horizontal axis now represents the
      physical, horizontal distance the ball has traveled, rather than the
      number of seconds elapsed since it was released.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vertical axis still represents the vertical position of the ball
      but since the position now requires two coordinates, <m>x</m> and <m>y,</m> we
      now simply label the vertical axis <q><m>y</m></q> as per tradition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason the two graphs are identical (except for the axis labels,
      of course) in this case is that we chose an initial horizontal
      velocity of <m>v(0)=1.</m> If we also choose our horizontal origin to be
      where we are standing when we release the ball, then the horizontal
      position is given by:
      <me>
        x=t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the initial vertical velocity is unchanged (as is the
      acceleraton due to gravity: <m>9.8 m/s^2</m>) the vertical position is
      still
      <me>
        p(t) = 5/3 + 15t-4.9t^2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We use <m>y</m> (instead of <m>p</m>) to represent the vertical position of the
      ball because the ball's position in this situation requires
      two<fn>Actually we need <m>3.</m> Do you see why we can ignore the
        third this time? If not, pause here and think about it for a moment.
      We'll wait.</fn>coordinates, <m>x</m> <em>and</em> <m>y,</m> whereas previously we only
      needed one, the <m>y</m> coordinate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we want to use <m>p</m> to represent the ball's position at time <m>t</m> (we
      do) then <m>p(t)</m> will have to return two coordinates for each value of
      <m>t:</m>
      <me>
        p(t) = \left(x(t), y(t)\right).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      To see why the two graphs above coincide we need only observe that
      since
      <me>
        x=t
      </me>
      it doesn't matter whether we label the horizontal axis <m>t,</m> in which
      caxse the graph gives the vertical position at any time <m>t,</m> or <m>x,</m>
      in which case the curve gives the actuall position of the eball. They
      <em>look</em> the same even if they mean different things.
    </p>

    <p>
      We got <m>x=t</m> because we assumed an initial horizontal velocity,
      <m>v_x(0)</m> of <m>1 m/s</m> and an initial horizontal position, <m>x_0</m> of
      zero.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/FallingBallPath2.png" />

    <p>
      Suppose we set our horizontal origin <m>2</m> meters to the left of where
      we released the ball. Then we get

                      on the <m>p-t</m> plane. (This should not necessarily look the same
                      as the graph you drew for part (b). (You should be curious about
                      the difference. In fact, you should be so curious that you will
                      spend a few minutes trying to puzzle out why and how they are
                      different. If you are not curious, pretend that you are and do
                      it anyway.)

    <p>
      The position of a moving object must always be given as a function of
      time because we always need to know when it arrives at some position
      along with the position itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When, like our falling ball, the object is moving both horizontally
      and vertically we clearly need two coordinates in order to specify its
      position. That is, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates depend on <m>t</m> as a
      common parameter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the equations
      <md>
        <mrow>x\amp =2t-3</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =5/3 + 15t-4.9t^2,</mrow>
      </md>
      are called <em>Parametric Equations.</em>

      We have barely scratched the surface of this important topic but this
      is enough for now. We will return to this in more depth later.
