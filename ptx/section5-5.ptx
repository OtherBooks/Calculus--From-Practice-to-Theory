        The area of a rectangle is <m>400 m^2.</m> Find a formula for the
        perimeter of the rectangle in terms of one of the sides of the
        rectangle. Remember to define what your variables are (along with
        their units). Also remember to include the possible values for
        your independent variable (the domain of your function).

            You throw a ball straight up with an initial velocity of
                  <m>50 m/s.</m> Assuming that there is no air resistance and that the
                  ball accelerates toward the earth at a constant rate of
                  <m>9.8 ((m/s))/s,</m> what would the ball's velocity be at <m>t</m>
                  seconds.

        If a promoter charges <m>\dollar50</m> each for concert tickets, then he/she
        will sell <m>15000</m> tickets. For each <m>\dollar1</m> increase in price per
        ticket, <m>100</m> tickets less will be sold. Determine a formula for
        the revenue based on the price per ticket, assuming that the price
        will be at least <m>\dollar50</m> per ticket.

        The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is <m>100</m> units. Find the
        area of the triangle as a function of the base. Don't forget to
        define your variables and give the domain of the function.

        A cylindrical tank must hold <m>500</m> cubic feet of water. The ends of
        the tank are cut from two individual squares of metal, and the
        side is constructed from one rectangular sheet of metal. The
        metal for the ends costs <m>\dollar5</m> per square foot and the metal for the
        side costs <m>\dollar4</m> per square foot. The weld for the seams costs <m>\dollar2</m>
        per linear foot. What is the cost of the tank (a) As a function of
        its height? (b) As a function of the radius? Don't forget
        to identify variables and to provide the domain.

        Consider a rectangular box with a square base whose volume is
        <m>500~ m^3.</m> Find the surface area of the box as a function of its
        height. Now find it as a function of the length of the side of
        the base. Don't forget to identify your variables and to provide
        the domain.

            The fixed cost for publishing a specific calculus book
                  is <m>\dollar100,000.</m> These are costs that the publisher would incur
                  no matter how many books were printed.  Beyond that, it costs
                  <m>\dollar20</m> per book to actually print the book.  If we let n denote
                  the number of books printed and <m>C=C(n)</m> denote the cost in
                  dollars from printing this many books, then give a formula for
                  the total cost to print <m>n</m> books.  What would the cost per book
                  be?

            Suppose the company plans to charge <m>\dollar150</m> per book.
                  Assuming the company can sell as many books as it produces (as
                  with a print-on-demand company), write a formula for the profit
                  <m>P</m> in dollars that the company would have from printing and
                  selling <m>n</m> books.  How many books would need to be sold to
                  break even?
