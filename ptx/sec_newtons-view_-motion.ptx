  <title>Newton's View: Motion as a Metaphor</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Newton invented Calculus for a specific purpose. He was trying to
      describe the physical motion. Naturally this affected the way that he
      thought about Calculus and the language he used to talk about
      it. Although he quickly realized that his Calculus could be used for
      other purposes his approach is deeply tied to the idea of motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newton's kinematic approach can be extended to other types of
      problems. Recall that in order to find out how high the tossed ball
      will go we first needed to discover how long it takes for the ball's
      velocity to drop to zero. This is, obviously, because the ball
      continues to rise until its velocity is zero. Thereafter it will
      fall. Once we know that the velocity is zero at time, say
      <m>t_{\text{ max } },</m> then we have <m>v(t_{\text{ max } })=0,</m> and the
      position, <m>p(t_{\text{ max } }),</m> at the same time is the maximimum
      height of the ball's flight.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is all fairly intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Can we use this same kind of reasoning to find the coordinates of the
      highest point on the graph at the right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the horizontal and vertical axes are no longer
      <q>position</q> and <q>time.</q> Since there is no motion taking place there
      is clearly no velocity, so we can't simply set our velocity function
      equal to zero an solve for the time, <m>t,</m> when velocity is zero like
      we did for the falling ball. Not only is there no velocity function,
      there is no time <m>(t)</m> either!
    </p>

    <p>
      Or can we? Yes, it is true that there is no motion, and no time
      involved. But so what? Once we plot velocity against time we just have
      a curve. The only place where either velocity or time appear is in the
      labelling of the axes.
    </p>

    <p>
      So let's just change the labels.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, let's pretend <mdash /> for now <mdash /> that this <em>is</em> a motion
      problem, that the vertical axis <em>is</em> position, and that the
      horizontal axis <em>is</em> time. In that case we can proceed as before:
      Find the velocity function (derivative), set it equal to zero to find
      the time (number of chocolate bars) when the velocity (derivative) is
      zero, put that back into the position (anxiety) function, <m>A(C),</m> to
      find the maximum level of anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was Newton's idea. Any such problem can be thought of as a
      problem of motion. In this case we think of our anxiety level as
      dependent on how many chocolate bars we have. If the number of
      chocolate bars changes then the anxiety level increases (or decreases)
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it is silly to rename our functions just to do the analysis and
      then change them back. Rather than explicitly pretending that motion
      is involved we keep that conceit in the background and adapt our
      notation and language to our motion metaphor.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular we have seen that <m>\dfdx{p}{t}=v,</m> (velocity is the
      derivative of position). Since velocity is by definition the rate of
      change of position <q>with respect to time</q> we adopt the convention,
      in this case, of interpreting the symbol <m>\dfdx{A}{C}</m> as the rate of
      change of anxiety <q>with respect to the number of chocolate bars we
      own.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this way the metaphor of motion is simply built into the language
      and notation we use, and we say things like <q>As the number of
      chocolate bars increases our anxiety decreases, then increases, and
      then decreases again,</q> just as if <m>C,</m> (the number of chocolate
      bars) is constantly increasing in the same way that <m>t,</m> (time) does.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <image width="37%" source="images/metaphor2.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      It can be illuminating to look at the graph of both our function and
      its derivative at the same time. The sketch at the left shows the graph
      of <m>A(C)</m> (in green) and <m>\dfdx{A}{C}</m> (in orange) together on the
      same set of axes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>A(0) = 5</m> when <m>C=0</m> we seem to be fairly anxious. This is probably
      because we have no chocolate. As our number of chocolate bars
      increases<fn>Notice how the language of motion is naturally
        co-opted for our purposes. We either own chocolate or we
        don't. Nothing is changing, but we pretend that as time goes on we
        are getting more chocolate.</fn>our anxiety level is decreasing so the value of <m>\dfdx{A}{C}</m> is
      negative (below the horizontal axis). When <m>\dfdx{A}{C} =0,</m> at
      slightly less than one chocolate bar, our anxiety level <q>bottoms
      out.</q> Presumably this is because we're looking forward to eating our
      chocolate. As we gain chocolate our anxiety level rises again,
      probably because in these uncertain times you never know who is
      coveting your chocolate, or when it might be taken from you just because you
      have a lot of it. As we accumulate more our anxiety level drops again
      because we have plenty to share so we don't need to worry about some
      theif taking it from us.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a silly example of course, but the point of this silliness is
      quite serious: The derivative of a curve can tell us a lot about the
      curve. If we simply pretend that the curve is the position of some
      object and that the derivative is its velocity then it is clear what
      the derivative can tell us:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the derivative is positive then the object is moving in the
              positive direction. Usually this will be <em>up</em> or <em>to the
                right</em>, but in any case the object moves in the positive direction
              whatever that is in our coordinate system.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the derivative is negative then the object is moving in the
              negative direction. Usually this will be <em>down</em> or <em>to the
                left</em>, but in any case the object moves in the negative direction
              whatever that is in our coordinate system.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the derivative is neither positive nor negative <mdash /> that is,
              if it is zero <mdash /> then the object has stopped moving<fn>Our
                metaphor actually breaks down a little bit here. No one would say
                that a vertically tossed ball is not moving at the top of its
                flight since it immediately begins to fall. Nevertheless, at the
                top of its flight its velocity is zero and it does <q>stop</q> just
                for an instant.</fn>.

      Suppose we have a single microbe living in a petri dish and that it
