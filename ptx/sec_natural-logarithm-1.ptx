  <title>The Natural Logarithm</title>
  <p>
    You may not have thought of it this way before, but exponentiation
    changes addition to multiplication and multiplication to
    exponentiation. Specifically, we have
    <me>
      b^{x+y}=b^x b^y,\ \ \ b^xy=(b^x )^y.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    The inverse function (a logarithm) will do exactly the opposite; it
    will change multiplication to addition and exponentiation to
    multiplication. Here are the details.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we mentioned in the last section, we need to look at the inverse of
    an exponential function. This inverse is call a logarithm. The word
    logarithm is a combination of two Greek words logos (reckoning) and
    arithmos (number), so literally a logarithm is a <q>reckoning number.</q>
    What does this mean?
  </p>

  <p>
    Logarithms were invented by John Napier <m>(1550-1617)</m> as a device which
    changes multiplication to addition. Nowadays, with the availability
    of handheld calculators, this may not seem like a big deal. However,
    back in the <m>16</m>th and <m>17</m>th centuries, where astronomy was growing and
    calculations were completed by hand, this was a major innovation.
    Think about it, is it easier to multiply astronomical numbers or to
    add them? As put forth by the mathematical historian Howard Eves, the
    invention of logarithms literally <q>doubled the life of the
    astronomer.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    While logarithms' computational value has diminished somewhat, the
    idea of changing multiplication to addition (and exponentiation to
    multiplication) is a valuable mathematical tool and we will have
    opportunities to exploit this. For now, let us see what the
    connection is to exponential functions.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>b>0,</m> and <m>x>0.</m> Then <m>y=\log_b x</m> exactly when <m>x=b^y.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    A few things to note on this definition.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The above definition says
          <me>
            b^{\log_b x} =b^y=x ,\  \log_b b^y =\log_b x=y.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The number <m>b</m> is called the base of the logarithm (and the
            exponential function) and is relegated to being a positive number.
            Furthermore, since <m>x=b^y,</m> then <m>x>0</m> is necessary as well.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    To see that the logarithm fulfills Napier's desire to change
    multiplication into addition and exponentiation into multiplication,
    we have the following result.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>b>0,</m> <m>x>0,</m> <m>y>0</m> and let <m>c</m> be any real number.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>(a)</title>
            <p>
              Show that <m>\log_b  xy=\log_b x+\log_b y.</m>  [Hint: Consider
                  <m>b^{\log_b x+\log_b y}</m>  and use properties of exponents to show that
                  this equals <m>xy.</m>]

                  Show that <m>\log_b x^c =c \log_b x.</m>  [Hint: Consider <m>b^{c
                    log_b x}</m> and use properties of exponents to show that this
                  equals <m>x^c.</m>]
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Just as <m>e^x</m> is called the natural exponential function, <m>y=\log_e x</m>
    is called the natural logarithm, and is denoted by <m>y=\ln x.</m> This is
    just what we need to deal with exponential growth (and decay) when the
    relative (nominal) growth rate is not explicitly given.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we have a bacteria culture which grows at a rate proportional
        to the amount present. We noticed that initially we have <m>2</m> grams, and
        <m>24</m> hours later we have <m>3</m> grams. How much would we have in <m>48</m> hours?
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we solve this, what is your guess? Will it be <m>4</m> grams? More?
        Less? Let's see.
      </p>

      <p>
        As before, let <m>B=B(t)</m> be the amount of bacteria (in grams) at time <m>t</m>
        (hours). Again, we know <m>B(0)=2.</m> Though we don't know what the
        relative growth rate is, we can call it something, say <m>k.</m> Thus we
        have
        <me>
          \dfdx{B}{t}=kB,\  B(0)=2,\text{ and }  B(24)=3.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The differential equation is satisfied by <m>B=Ce^kt</m> for some constant
        <m>C.</m> Utilizing our initial condition, we can determine <m>C.</m>
        <me>
          2=B(0)=Ce^{k\cdot0}=C\cdot1=C.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        So <m>C=2</m> and we have <m>B=2e^kt.</m> To determine <m>k,</m> we will utilize our
        other bit of information.
        <md>
          <mrow>3\amp =B(24)=2e^24k</mrow>
          <mrow>3/2\amp =e^24k</mrow>
          <mrow>\ln \frac{3}{2}\amp =24k</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{1}{24} \ln \frac{3}{2}\amp =k.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus <m>B=2e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln \frac{3}{2}\right)t}.</m> This is kind
        of cumbersome, so let's use properties of exponents and logarithms to
        clean it up before we look at <m>B(48).</m>
        <me>
          B=(e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln \frac{3}{2}\right)t} = \left(e^{\ln(3/2)}\right)^\frac{t}{24}  =\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}
        </me>
        <me>
          B(48)=\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^(48/24)=\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2=\frac{9}{4}=2.25
          \text{ grams } .
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        How does this match your guess?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    A natural question is to ask how long
    will it take for the culture to reach <m>4</m> grams. Translating this into
    a mathematical question, we want <m>t</m> when <m>B=4.</m>
    <md>
      <mrow>4\amp =\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}</mrow>
      <mrow>\ln 4\amp =\ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\frac{t}{24} \ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>t\amp =\frac{24  \ln 4}{\ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \approx 82.06 hours.</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, this assumes that the exponential model holds for that long
    a period of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Exponential functions are not only used to model growth, but also
    decay. This is especially important when speaking of radioactive
    decay. You might have heard terms such as radiocarbon dating and
    half-life, but what do these terms mean? Let's look at both.
  </p>

  <p>
    Radiocarbon dating is a technique for dating organic material from the
    past. It was developed by Willard Libby in <m>1949</m> and revolutionized
    the field of archeology. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
    in <m>1960</m> for this development. Radiocarbon <m>(C_{14})</m> is a
    radioactive isotope of carbon which is constantly being created in the
    atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric
    nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen
    to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants
    by photosynthesis; animals then acquire <m>C_{14}</m> by eating the
    plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with
    its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> it
    contains begins to decrease as the <m>C_{14}</m> undergoes radioactive
    decay. Measuring the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> in a sample from a dead plant
    or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides
    information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant
    died
  </p>

  <pre>
    .
  </pre>

  <p>
    This is where the notion of half-life comes into play. The half-life
    of <m>C_{14}</m> is about <m>5,730</m> years. This means that given any initial
    amount of <m>C_{14},</m> in <m>5,730</m> years, half of the radiocarbon will
    remain (the other half having decayed). Of course, the decaying
    process is gradual. It is reasonable to assume that the rate of decay
    of the radiocarbon (or any radioactive material) is proportional to
    the amount present. After all, the more material there is, the more
    there is to decay. All of these ideas are incorporated in the
    following example.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
    <p>
      The Shroud of Turin is a religious relic which is reputed to be the
      burial shroud of Jesus and bears the image of a man which is alleged
      to be that of Jesus. The Vatican agreed to subject pieces of the
      shroud to radiocarbon dating in <m>1987.</m> To examine this, let
      <m>A=A(t)</m> be the amount of <m>14C</m> (in mg) at time <m>t</m> years, where <m>t=0</m>
      represents when the shroud was used. Let <m>A(0)=A_0</m> be the initial
      amount of <m>C_{14}</m> present in the sample. How much <m>C_{14}</m> would be present
      if the shroud was 2000 years old? Mathematically, we have
      <me>
        \dfdx{A}{t}=kA,\ \ \ A(0)=A_0,\ \ \text{ and }    A(5730)=\frac{1}{2} A_0,
      </me>
      and we want to know what <m>A(2000)</m> is.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution of the differential equation and initial condition is <m>A=A_0e^kt.</m> To determine <m>k,</m> we utilize the half-life.
      <md>
        <mrow>1/2 A_0\amp =A(5730)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =A_0 e^5730k</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{2}\amp =e^5730k</mrow>
        <mrow>k\amp =1/5730 ln \frac{1}{2}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this is negative since <m>\ln (1/2)=-ln 2.</m> This makes
      sense. This the growth rate should be negative since the amount of
      <m>C_{14}</m> is shrinking. Thus
      <me>
        A=A_0 e^{\frac{1}{5730}\ln (1/2) }t=A_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right))^\frac{t}{5730}
      </me>
      and so
      <me>
        A(2000)=A_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{2000}{5730}} \approx 0.785A_0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This says that an authentic shroud should contain about <m>78.5\%</m> of the original amount.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          One of the samples contained <m>88.9\%</m> of the original <m>C_{14}.</m> How
          old would this sample be?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      The technique of carbon dating is not in dispute, but there are issues
      about the quality of the sample and other issues. Interested readers

    You should already be familiar with logarithms as the inverses of
    exponentials. That is, if <m>f(x)=10^x</m> and <m>\inverse{f}(x)=\log_{10}(x)</m>
    then
    <me>
      f\left(\inverse f(x)\right) = 10^{\log_{10}(x)}=x
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      \inverse f\left(f(x)\right) = \log_{10}(10^x) = x.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will define the <q>natural logarithm</q> in precisely the same way.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = e^x</m> then <m>\inverse f(x) = \log_e(x),</m> where
        <me>
          f\left(\inverse f(x)\right) = e^{\log_{e}(x)}=x
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          \inverse f\left(f(x)\right) = \log_{e}(e^x) = x.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    \begin{mynotation}{Natural Logarithm}
    The natural logarithm is often shortened to <m>\ln(x).</m> We will use
    this shortened form hereafter.
    \end{mynotation}
  </p>

  <p>
    A natural question to ask is, ``What is the derivative of <m>\ln(x)?</m> At
    first this may seem to be a difficult question to answer but
    it is actually quite straight-forward. In fact, we will use the same
    trick that we used to obtain
    <m>\dfdx{\inverse\sin(x)}{x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    First let <m>y=\ln(x)</m> and then we simply differentiate both sides of
    <me>
      e^y=x
    </me>
    to obtain
    <md>
      <mrow>e^y\dfdx{y}{x} \amp =1</mrow>
      <intertext>from which</intertext>
      <mrow>\dfdx{y}{x}    \amp = \frac{1}{e^y}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{e^{\ln(x)}}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{x}.</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus we have the following:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>y=e^x.</m> Then <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = e^x.</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>y=\ln(x).</m> Then <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac1x.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Aside from being the inverse function of an exponential, a logarithm
    is an important function in its own right, as illustrated in the
    following problem.
  </p>
