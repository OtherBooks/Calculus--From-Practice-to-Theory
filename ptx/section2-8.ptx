    <title>The Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Recall that if <m>x</m> is in the interval <m>(-\pi/2,\pi/2)</m> and <m>\sin x =
        y,</m> then by definition
        <m>\inverse{\sin} y = x.</m> The function <m>\inverse\sin x</m> is called the
        inverse function of the sine, or sometimes the <m>\arcsin x</m> (pronounced
        <q>arc sine of x.</q>) There are similar inverse functions for each of
        the six trigonometric functions. In this section we will derive
        differentals of each of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we do that though, let's look at a specific, simpler situation. If we
        start with the line,
        <me>
          3x-4y+2=0
        </me>
        then <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> is given by: <m>y(x) = \frac34x+\frac12</m>
        whereas <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> is given by <m>x(y) =
        \frac43y-\frac23.</m>
        From these it is clear that <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac34 =
        \frac{1}{\frac43}=\frac{1}{\dfdx{x}{y}}.</m> Can we generalize from this
        that <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{1}{\dfdx{x}{y}}?</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, yes and no.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that this example is too simple. When the expressions
        involved are even slightly more complex we need to be very careful and
        precise in our use of notation. We illustrate this in the next
        example.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
          For this example we only consider positive<fn>It probably
              isn't clear why this is important. Try to figure it out. We'll
              return to this later, but it will be easier to understand if you
              give the question some serious thought now.</fn>values of <m>x.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose <m>y</m> is given as a function of <m>x</m> by the formula: <m>y=x^2.</m>
          Then clearly <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> is given by: <m>x=\sqrt{y}.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Clearly <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = 2x,</m> and <m>\dfdx{x}{y}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}.</m>
          But wait! Aren't these supposed to be mutually reciprocal? How is
          <m>\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}</m> the reciprocal of <m>2x?</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          In this example it is not hard to see what is happening. Since
          <m>y=x^2</m> clearly <m>\sqrt{y}=x</m> so that in fact
          <me>
            \dfdx{x}{y}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} = \frac{1}{2x}
          </me>
          which is the reciprocal of <m>2x</m> as required.
        </p>

        <problem>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Verify that <m>f(x) = \frac34x+\frac12,</m> and <m>\inverse f(x) =
                \frac43y-\frac23</m> truly are mutually inverse.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </problem>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        When the formulas involved are more complex or, as in the next
        example, especially when they are more abstract it can be very
        confusing and harder to resolve the confusion. We will reserve a
        detailed discussion of these issues and their subtleties for a later
        chapter. For now we just note we must be very careful differentiating
        when inverse functions are involved. The issue has less with our
        understanding than with our notation.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            {<em>A COMMON MISTAKE; DON'T DO THIS!</em>}
          </p>

          <p>
            Clearly then if <m>\inverse\sin x</m> is the inverse of <m>\sin x</m> we have
            <me>
              \d\left(\inverse \sin x\right) = \frac{1}{\d(\sin x)}= \frac{1}{\cos
                  x\d x}= \frac{\sec x}{\d x},
            </me>
            right?
          </p>

          <p>
            As we indicated this is a common error so obviously, this is not
            correct. But it certainly seems like it ought to be doesn't it? Let's
            see what's wrong with it.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        Notice that in
        <xref ref="eq_ReciprocalInverseDeriv">equation</xref> we have the variable <m>y</m> on
        the left and the variable <m>x</m> on the right side of the equation,
        whereas in our example we used only the <m>x</m> variable. This is clearly
        not a correct use of our formula, but it is an incredibly easy mistake
        to make. When we use general results in mathematics we must make
        absolutely certain that our usage is consistent with the statement
        of the result in <em>all</em> of its particulars.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec_diff-inverse-sine">
    <title>The Derivative of the Inverse Sine and Cosine
      Functions</title>
    <p>
      In the following watch the roles of the <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m> variables closely. Since we are differentiating the <em>inverse</em>
      function we are reversing the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y.</m> That is, we are
      thinking of <m>y</m> as the dependent and <m>x</m> as the independent variable
      so it seems natural to write <m>x = \inverse\sin(y).</m> However, there is
      no reason not to use <m>y=\sin(x)</m> as long as we keep in mind that we're
      thinking of <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> and that we are trying to
      compute <m>\dfdx{x}{y}</m> and not its reciprocal, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      So if
      <md>
        <mrow>y\amp =\sin(x) \text{ then }</mrow>
        <mrow>\d y \amp = \cos(x)\d x</mrow>
        <intertext>and solving for <m>\dfdx{x}{y}</m> gives</intertext>
        <mrow>\dfdx{x}{y} \amp = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This must be correct since if we take the reciprocal of both sides we
      get <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \cos(x)</m> which we know is correct. But this
      formula is almost completely useless for our present purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we are thinking of <m>x</m> as the dependent and <m>y</m> as the
      independent variables (<m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>) we would really like
      to express <m>\dfdx{x}{y}</m> in terms of <m>y,</m> not <m>x.</m> It is as if, given
      <m>y=x^2</m> we had found that <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2\sqrt{y}.</m> This is true (since
      <m>\sqrt{y} =x</m>) but almost useless.
    </p>

    <p>
      So our problem now is to express the right side of the formula
      <m>\dfdx{x}{y} = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m> in terms of the dependent variable
      <m>y</m> instead of the dependent variable <m>x.</m> This is entirely an
      exercise in trigonometry as we now show.
    </p>

    <p>
      First observe that since <m>y=\sin(x)</m> we have
      <m>x=\inverse\sin y</m>
      so that
      <me>
        \dfdx{x}{y} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\inverse\sin y\right)}.
      </me>
      so apparently all we have to do is figure out what
      <m>\cos\left(\inverse\sin y\right)</m> is in terms of <m>x.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      This may seem a daunting task but this is an illusion caused mostly by
      unwieldy notation. That is, it just looks scary. But it would be silly
      to let our own notation frighten us. Besides, if we take it one piece
      at a time it isn't so bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>y=\sin(x)</m> then <m>y</m> is a number and <m>x</m> is an angle and we can
      visualize this as in the following sketch:
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/arcsin1.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>x</m> is the dependent variable it makes sense to read the formula
      <m>x=\inverse\sin y</m> as <q><m>x</m> is the angle whose sine is <m>y</m>.</q> Since we
      want to find the <m>\cos(x)</m> we see from our sketch and the Pythagorean
      Theorem that
      <me>
        \cos(x)=\cos\left(\inverse\sin y\right) = \sqrt{1-y^2}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore
      <me>
        \dfdx{x}{y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-y^2}}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      \begin{mynotation}
      Again, this is correct and we appear to be finished. Unfortunately
      we have one more small point to make. This one will feel like we are
      just going out of our way to make things difficult but we
      aren't. This last change is not about understanding the concepts, it
      is just about how
    </p>

    <p>
      The inverse sine is an elementary function and equations using it
      will most commonly be written like this
      <me>
        y = \inverse\sin x,
      </me>
      with <m>x</m> taking the role of the independent variable as usual.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, unless there is a compelling reason to use <m>y</m> as the
      independent variable the custom is to use <m>x.</m> In our derivation of
      the derivative of the inverse sine we had a compelling reason to use
      <m>y.</m> Having completed the derivation we now revert to the customary
      usage.
      \end{mynotation}
    </p>

    <p>
      We have five more trigonometric functions to invert and differentiate
      so let's get going. Fortunately the derivations are all essentially
      the same so we will abbreviate the discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose <m>y=\inverse\cos x</m> so that <m>x=\cos y.</m> Then
      <md>
        <mrow>\d x \amp = \frac{1}{\d(\cos y)}\d y</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{-\sin y}\d y</mrow>
        <intertext>and thus,</intertext>
        <mrow>\dfdx{x}{y} \amp = \frac{-1}{\sin \left(\inverse\cos y\right)}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      From the sketch below
    </p>

    <p>
      <image width="37%" source="images/arccos1.png" />
      it should be clear that <m>\sin\left(\inverse\cos x\right)=
      \sqrt{1-y^2},</m> so
      <me>
        \dfdx{x}{y} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-y^2}}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So again switching to the customary usage, if <m>y=\inverse\sin x</m> we have <m>\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.</m>
    </p>

      secant and cosecant functions the correct formula for the differential

        \d (\inverse\sec x) = \frac{1}{\abs{x}\sqrt{x^2-1}} \d x,

      and similarly for the inverse cosecant. But we have enough on our

      the moment. All of the formulas given below are correct.
