  <title>Representations of Polynomials</title>
  <p>
    Notice that when we write <m>121_{10}</m> as
    <me>
      121_{10} = 1+2\cdot10+1\cdot10^2
    </me>
    the expression on the right has the form of a polynomial. That is, if
    we replace each instance of the base <m>10</m> with <m>x</m> we get the polynomial
    <m>1+2\cdot x+1\cdot x^2.</m> Polynomials can be thought of as numbers
    where the base is <m>x</m> (or that it is unspecified).
  </p>

  <p>
    We will very soon find it very convenient to to be able to convert
    polynomials to different bases just like we converted numbers in the
    last section. Fortunately, the method we've just developed carries
    over unchanged.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The polynomial <m>p(x) = 1+2x+x^2</m> is represented with <m>x</m> as the
        base. Convert it to the base <m>(x-1).</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        As before, we want to find coefficients <m>a_0, a_1,</m> and <m>a_2</m> so
        that
        <me>
          1+2x+x^2 = a_0 + a_1(x-1) + a_2(x-1)^2.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Dividing both sides by <m>x-1</m> we get
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>{}On the right:</title>
            <p>
              <m>a_1+a_2(x-1)</m> with the remainder <m>a_0.</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>{}On the left:</title>
            <p>
              <m>x+3</m> with the remainder <m>4.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        So <m>a_0=4</m> and <m>x+3=a_1+a_2(x-1).</m> Dividing again by <m>x-1</m> gives
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>{}On the right:</title>
            <p>
              <m>a_2</m> with the remainder <m>a_1.</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>{}On the left:</title>
            <p>
              <m>1</m> with the remainder <m>4.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore
        <me>
          1+2x+x^2 = 4+4(x-1)+(x-1)^2.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Confirm the result in the previous example.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    For reasons that we will make clear later, we don't normally refer to
    this re-representation of polynomials as a <q>change of base<fn>even
    though that is really what it is.</fn>.</q>
    Instead, when we convert from base <m>x</m> to base <m>x-a</m> for some <m>a</m> we
    say we are <q>expanding the polynomial about the number <m>a.</m></q> When the
    base is <m>x</m> we say that the polynomial is expanded about the number
    <m>0.</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    A more substantial example is in order.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Expand the polynomial <m>p(x) = x^5+3x^4-15x^2+1</m> about the number
        <m>2.</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        As before we have
        <me>
          x^5+3x^4-15x^2+1 =
          a_0+a_1(x-2)+a_2(x-2)^2+a_3(x-2)^3+a_4(x-2)^4+a_5(x-2)^5.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Dividing both sides by <m>x-2</m> gives
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>{}On the right:</title>
            <p>
              <m>a_1+a_2(x-2)+a_3(x-2)^2+a_4(x-2)^3+a_5(x-2)^4</m> with remainder <m>a_0.</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>{}On the left:</title>
            <p>
              <m>x^4+5x^3+10x^2+5x+10</m> with remainder <m>21.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus <m>a_0 = 21</m> and
        <me>
          x^4+5x^3+10x^2+5x+10 = a_1+a_2(x-2)+a_3(x-2)^2+a_4(x-2)^3+a_5(x-2)^4.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Dividing again we have
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>{}On the right:</title>
            <p>
              <m>a_2+a_3(x-2)+a_4(x-2)^2+a_5(x-2)^3</m> with
                remainder <m>a_1.</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>{}On the left:</title>
            <p>
              <m>x^3+7x^2+24x+53</m> with remainder <m>116.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus <m>a_1=116</m> and
        <me>
          x^3+7x^2+24x+53 = a_2+a_3(x-2)+a_4(x-2)^2+a_5(x-2)^3.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuing in this fashion gives <m>a_2= 137</m> and
        <me>
          x^2+9x+42 = a_3+a_4(x-2)+a_5(x-2)^2,
        </me>
        and then <m>a_3=64</m> and
        <me>
          x+11 = a_4+a_5(x-2),
        </me>
        from which it is clear that <m>a_5= 1</m> and <m>a_4=13.</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore
        <me>
          x^5+3x^4-15x^2+1 =
          21+116(x-2)+137(x-2)^2+64(x-2)^3+13(x-2)^4+(x-2)^5.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Verify the result in the previous example.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    If we expand the polynomial <m>p(x) = x^3</m> about the number <m>1</m> we get
    <me>
      x^3 = a_0+a_1(x-1) +a_2(x-1)^2+a_3(x-1)^3.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Proceeding as before we find that <m>a_0=1</m> and <m>a_2= 3.</m> If, rather
    than completing the conversion we stop here it is reasonable to expect
    that the graphs of <m>l(x) = a_0+a_1(x-1) = 1+3(x-1)</m> and <m>p(x) = x^3</m>
    should be related, and indeed, when we graph both polynomials on the
    same set of axes we see the following.
    <image width="37%" source="images/LinearTaylor.png" />
  </p>

  <p>
    Hey! Wait a second! We've seen things like this before!
  </p>

  <p>
    This appears to be the graph of <m>p(x)=x^3</m> and its tangent line at
    <m>x=1.</m> Is this just an artifact of this particular problem or is it
    generally true?
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly this is general. If we have an unspecified polynomial expanded
    about the number <m>a,</m> <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1(x-a) + a_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots +
    a_m(x-a)^n</m> then clearly <m>p(a) = a_1</m> and <m>\dfdx{p}{x}(a) = a_1.</m> So
    it seems that in computing the coefficients <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m> we have
    found the line tangent to <m>p(x)</m> at <m>x=a.</m> What do you suppose we will
    find when we compute <m>a_2?</m>
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find <m>a_2</m> graph <m>x^3</m> and <m>a_0 + a_1(x-a) + a_2(x-a)^2</m>
        on the same set of axes. What do you observe?
      </p>
    </statement>
