  <title>Derivatives of Transcendental Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The differentiation rules we've learned so far are general in the
      sense that they are applicable to a wide variety of functions. That is, we
      can use them to compute the differential of each of the following:
      <md>
        <mrow>y\amp =(x-1)^3\left(\sqrt{x^2-3}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>[2mm]
          y\amp =\frac{(x-1)^3}{\sqrt{x^2-3}}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The formula can change, but the differentiation rules still work.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compute <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> for each of the curves above.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      As useful as the differentiation rules we've worked out so far are
      they are not enough. The fact is that differentiation rules come
      in two flavors: those like the ones we've seen already which are
      general and work in a wide variety of situations, and the rules which
      apply to specific expressions, like <m>\sin(x),</m> which simply have to be
      memorized. In this section we will work out the differentiation rules
      for all of the trigonometric functions, and all of the inverses of
      trigonometric functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This may sound like a large undertaking but it turns out that there
      are many similarities in the development of each of these. These can
      be exploited to make the development easier and, perhaps more
      importantly, to make the memorization process a little easier too.
    </p>

    <p>
      But make no mistake, we are developing basic tools here. Learn
      them. {Memorize them!} It will be expected hereafter that you have all
      of these techniques at your fingertips at all times.

    <title>The Derivative of the Sine and Cosine Functions</title>
    <p>
      Consider the sketch below
      <image width="37%" source="images/DiffSin.png" />
      where we have a unit circle with an angle, <m>x,</m> in standard
      position. Notice that <m>\sin(x) = AB.</m> If we allow the angle to vary by
      an infinitesimal amount, <m>\d x,</m> then the sides of the triangle
      <m>\Delta BDC</m> are also infinitesimally small, so that <m>\d(\sin(x)) =
      BD,</m> and <m>\d{x}=CD.</m> Moreover, since this in a <em>unit</em> circle we
      also have <m>\d x = BC</m><fn>Because when the radius of a circle is
        one, the radian measure of the the central angle is the same as the
        arclength of the subtended angle. This is the whole point of using
        radian measure.</fn></p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Finally, triangles <m>\Delta OAB</m> and <m>\Delta DBC</m> are similar, but we
          will leave that as an exercise for you.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Therefore from the properties of similar
      triangles,
      <me>
        \frac{\d(\sin(x))}{\d x} = \frac{\cos(x)}{1}
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        \frac{\d(\sin(x))}{\d x} = \cos(x)
      </me>
      which is our next differentiation formula.
    </p>

    <p>
      {Objection! <m>BC</m> is not a straight line, so <m>\Delta DBC</m>
      isn't really a triangle. This <q>proportion</q> is not true.}
      \-\marginpar{ We may want to have an <q>Objection</q> construct which we can

      This last example actually gives us the differential of the

          Recall that in spin casting [p. <xref ref="SpinCasting"></xref>], we gave you
          the formula for centripetal force. Specifically, for a mass <m>m</m>
          revolving in a circle of radius <m>r</m> meters around an axis with an
          angular speed of <m>\omega</m> radians/second, the centripetal force is a force
          directed toward the axis. This force keeps the mass going in a
          circle instead of traveling off in a straight line.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formula given for the magnitude of this force was
          <me>
            mr\omega^2
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          We will use our knowledge of trigonometric functions to
          derive this.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, recall that <em>force=mass<times />acceleration.</em> Thus we want to
          show that the centripetal acceleration is given by <m>r\omega^2.</m>

      Remember all of those identities you had to memorize in trigonometry?
      You can reduce the memorization burden a bit by using Calculus. It
      turns out that if you differentiate an identity you get another
      identity! This is because if two variable quantities are equal then
      their differentials must be equal too.

      {{ Foreshadowing: What does it really mean when a differential is zero?}}
      This example is actually much more interesting, and important, than it
      first appears to be. We will digress for a moment to see why.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have seen that the differential
      of a constant is <em>necessarily</em> zero. Is the reverse also true?
      That is, if we can show that the differential of some expression
      is zero can we conclude that the expression is constant? Symbolically,
      does <m>\d y = 0</m> imply that <m>y=c,</m> where <m>c</m> is some constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be definite, we showed in <xref ref="Sin2Cos2">example</xref> that
      <m>\d(\sin^2x+\cos^2x)=0.</m> Can<fn>Since we already know that <m>\sin^2x+\cos^2x=1</m>
      the question may seem silly. However when examining new ideas or
      concepts it is always a good idea to start with a question whose
      answer is known. That way we can tell whether our intuition is leading
      us astray. In particular we are not asking, <q>Is <m>\sin^2(x) +
      \cos^2(x)</m> a constant?</q> We already know that it is. Instead we are
      asking <q>Does  <m>\sin^2(x) +
      \cos^2(x)</m> <em>have</em> <em>to</em> <em>be</em> a constant,
      given that it's derivative is zero?</q> This is a different question.</fn></p>

    <p>
      First, as a matter of logic, the statement:
      <q>If <m>y</m> is constant, then <m>\d y=0.</m></q>is <em><em><em> not</em></em></em> the same as the
      statement:
      <q>If <m>\d y=0,</m> then <m>y</m> is a constant.</q>To see this a more banal example is useful. Consider the statement:
      If it is raining, then I will open my umbrella.''This is clearly <em>not</em> the same as:
      If my umbrella is open, then it is raining.''because I could open my umbrella for any number of reasons in addition
      to rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, knowing that
      <q>If <m>y</m> is constant then <m>\d y=0''</m>is not sufficient
      to conclude that
      ``If <m>\d y=0</m> then <m>y</m> is constant.</q>Nevertheless when we think about the meaning of the statement <m>\d y=0</m>
      it certainly seems like it <em>ought</em> to be true that <m>y</m> is
      constant. After all, this says that infinitesimal changes in <m>y</m> are
      <em>always</em> zero. Or, to put it another way, it says that <m>y</m> is
      not changing. If <m>y</m> is not changing then <m>y</m> is constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, consider: <m>y=\frac{x}{x-1}-\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}.</m>
      It is straightforward to show that <m>\d y=0</m> but it is not at all clear
      that <m>y</m> is constant.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>\d\left(\frac{x}{x-1}-\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}\right)=0.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      The point of the foregoing discussion is to convince you that the
      statement
      <q>If <m>\d y=0</m> then <m>y</m> is constant</q>is in fact true, even though we can not yet prove that it is true<fn>But
      we will eventually.</fn>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, to see why this is important here is a problem that we will
      eventually need to be able to solve.

        <p>
          Can we reconstruct <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m> from

          Obviously the answer is yes, else this example is pointless, but how?

      The hard part of <xref ref="ex_exact-differential">example</xref>, of course, was finding <m>z=x\sin y.</m>
      Eventually you'll learn how to do that yourself, but not today. Also,
      it would be helpful to know the value of <m>c.</m> But again, not
      today.
