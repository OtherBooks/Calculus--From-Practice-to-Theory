      Suppose we have a single microbe living in a petri dish and that it
      divides once every hour. Then after one hour we have two microbes and
      our population has grown by one microbe per hour. After the second
      hour our population is now <m>4</m> microbes, and the rate of growth during
      that second hour is <m>3</m> microbes per hour. If this continues for <m>10</m>
      hours our microbe population will have grown according to the
      following chart\-\marginpar{ This is supposed to be <m>P(t)=(5/2)^t.</m> Check the numbers.}:

    <p>
      Can we find a function <m>P(t)</m> which tells us our microbe
      population at any time?
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Logistic Growth</title>
    <p>
      Before, we looked at exponential growth models, that is models
      governed by the equation
      <me>
        \dfdx{p}{t}=rp.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, <m>p=p(t)</m> is the population level at time <m>t</m> and <m>r</m> is the
      (continuous) growth rate of the population. Recall that the solution
      to this is the exponential function <m>p=p_0 e^rt</m> where <m>p_0</m> is the
      initial population. As we pointed out, this model is really only
      applicable in the short run, as this function grows exponentially.
      For example, if <m>r=10=.1</m>) and <m>p_0=1</m> gram of a bacteria population,
      and <m>t</m> is measured in hours, then <m>p(100)=e^.1(100)\approx{}22026</m> grams and
      <m>p(200)=e^.1(200)\approx{}485165195</m> grams. Clearly, there are limitations to
      this model. This is the case with all mathematical models which, of
      necessity, must be simplified to make tractable. People who model
      with mathematics understand this and the mantra is to start simple,
      and add on extra complications. While no model will be exactly real
      life, the idea is to put in enough complexity to approximately real
      life, while keeping the model simple enough to use. We will do this
      in this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, consider the differential equation
      <me>
        \dfdx{p}{t}=.1p\left(1-\frac{p}{500}\right).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this is similar to the differential equation for
      exponential growth, but has an extra factor, namely <m>(1-p/500).</m> The
      <m>500</m> is called the carrying capacity of the environment (notice that it
      must be measured in grams to match the unit of <m>p</m>). This number
      represents the limitation placed on the population by the environment,
      and does not allow the population to grow exponentially without bound.

            <p>
              Show that for <m>0\lt p\lt 500</m> the population is growing, and
                  for <m>p>500</m> the population is shrinking.  Does the name carrying
                  capacity make sense now?  Explain.  Plot a graph of growth rate
                  vs. time.

            <title>(c)</title>
            <p>
              For what values of p is the growth rate increasing (that is,
                  the population's level is accelerating)?  For what values is the
                  population's growth rate decreasing?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(d)</title>
            <p>
              According to the model, what happens to the population if it
                  should ever hit <m>500?</m>  What happens to the growth rate as p
                  approaches <m>500?</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>(e)</title>
            <p>
              On the same set of axes, draw reasonable graphs of the
                  population level <m>p(t)</m> with the given initial values:
                  <m>p(0)=100,</m> <m>p(0)=300,</m> <m>p(0)=500,</m> <m>p(0)=600.</m>  (It is a fact from the
                  theory of differential equations that these trajectories will
                  never cross.  You can assume this when you draw your graphs.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This model is called a logistic growth model, and is a refinement of
          the original exponential model. Notice that for small values of <m>p,</m>
          the factor <m>(1-p/500)\approx 1</m> and the model is very much like exponential
          growth. However, this model is more refined than the original as it
          better illustrates the fact that the population cannot grow
          exponentially without bound. Notice also, that this differential
          equation is a bit harder to solve (we will learn integration
          techniques to solve it later). Nonetheless, we were able to use it to
          provide reasonable qualitative graphs of <m>p(t)</m> without actually having
          an equation for <m>p(t).</m>

          Alas, with every model, the logistic model also has limitations.
          Consider the following refinement of that model.

          Use the graph of <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> to plot
          reasonable graphs of <m>p(t)</m> for various initial values. Specifically
          use <m>p(0)=15, 20, 150, 400, 500, 600.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice that even without having a formula for <m>p(t),</m> we were able
          to understand it from information given by the function
          <m>\dfdx{p}{t}.</m> This function has a special name, the derivative. The
          history of this name is interesting and represents a shift in the
          study of calculus. Throughout the 1700's, infinitesimal
          differentials were utilized to help explain physical and
          mathematical phenomena (as you have experienced in this book so
          far). There were issues as to what an infinitely small quantity is,
          but it was overshadowed by its power and utility. Too make a long
          story short, foundational issues as to what an infinitely small
          difference is grew in importance. To help address these issues,
          Joseph Louis Lagrange developed the concept of a <em>fonction d&#xe9;riv&#xe9;e</em>,
          that is a function derived from the original function. Thus instead
          of focusing on curves, this marked the beginning of focusing on
          functions and derivatives instead of infinitely small differentials
          (useful as they are). He even developed an new notation, <m>f^\prime(x),</m>
          instead of <m>\dfdx{f}{x}.</m> Today these symbols are synonymous, but
          in Lagrange's day, it represented an attempt to suppress the
          infinitely small. In practice, it is still advantageous to utilize
          the older differential notation, but there are times where the
          <q>prime</q> notation has its advantages, especially when one wants to
          focus on the derivative as a function rather than a process
          (differentiation). One of the first places is what we've been
          doing, namely gathering information from a function by examining its
          derivative.

    <title>Compound Interest and the Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      Suppose I invest money in a bond which nominally pays 5<percent /> annually,
      compounded quarterly. The effective yield would be 5.09<percent />. What does
      any of this mean?
    </p>

    <p>
      To start, the effective yield represents the actual amount of money I
      will have earned at the end of one year. For example, if the
      investment was not compounded at all, then at the end on one year,
      every dollar invested would yield <m>\dollar1.05</m> in return. If the investment
      is compounded semiannually, then this means that half of interested
      earned in paid out halfway through the year. This money is then
      re-invested for the next half year. This is summarized in the
      following table.

    <p>
      The effective yield comes from the last entry in the table. That is,
      it is the difference between the amount the investment is worth at the
      end of the year and what it is worth at the beginning of the year:
      <m>1.0509-1=.0509=5.09\%.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the same reasoning, if the investment was compounded daily,
      then the effective yield would be <m>(1+.05/365)^{365}-1\approx.0513=5.13\%.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, if we compound n times in a year, then the return the
      investment on one dollar at the end of one year would be
      <me>
        \left(1+\frac{.05}{n}\right)^n.

      What if the investment was compounded continuously? What does this
      mean, and what would the value <m>p(t)</m> be? To examine this, it will be
      convenient to write <m>p(t)</m> as
      <me>
        p(t)=\left(1+\left(\frac{.05}{n}\right)\right)^{\frac{n(.05t)}{.05}}
        =\left[\left(1+\frac{.05}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{.05}}\right]^{.05t}
        =\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{.05}}\right)^{\frac{n}{.05}}\right]^{.05t}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's rewrite <m>m=\frac{n}{.05},</m> and consider what would happen if we
      compounded a very large number of times (let <m>n</m> be very large).
      <xref ref="tab_4">Table</xref> looks at some values of
      <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m,</m> where <m>m</m> is large.

    <p>
      It would appear from <xref ref="tab_4">Table</xref>, that <m>(1+\frac{1}{m})^m</m> approaches a fixed number
      as <m>m</m> becomes indefinitely large. This will be given more precision
      later, but for now let's assume that it does and call this number <m>e.</m>
      By the table, it appears that <m>e\approx{}2.71828169255.</m> All of this suggests
      that if the investment is being continually compounded, then
      <me>
        p(t)=e^.05t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's examine the situation from a different perspective. If we abuse
      notation by letting <m>p(t)</m> be the amount that the investment is worth
      at time <m>t</m> in <xref ref="tab_1">Tables</xref>, <xref ref="tab_2"></xref>, <xref ref="tab_3"></xref> as well,
      then <xref ref="tab_1">Table</xref> says
      <me>
        p(0)=1,\ p(1/2)=(1+.05/2),p(0), \ p(2/2)=(1+.05/2)p(1/2).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, <xref ref="tab_2">Table</xref> says
      <me>
        p(0)=1,\ p(1/3)=(1+.05/3)p(0),\ p(2/3)=(1+.05/3)p(1/3),\ p(3/3)=(1+.05/3)p(2/3).
      </me>
      and <xref ref="tab_3">Table</xref> says
      <me>
        p(0)=1,\ p(1/4)=(1+.05/4)p(0),\ p(2/4)=(1+.05/4)p(1/4),\ p(3/4)=(1+.05/4)p(2/4),\ p(4/4)=(1+.05/4)p(3/4).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we let <m>\Delta t=1/n</m> denote the change in time, then this can be
      written more succinctly as
      <me>
        \Delta p=p(t+ \Delta t)-p(t)=(1+.05\cdot\Delta
        t)p(t)-p(t)=.05\cdotp(t)\cdot\Delta t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Extrapolating this to the case of continuous compounding where we use
      the infinitesimal quantity <q><m>\d t</m></q> instead of the increment <m>\Delta t,</m> we have
      that the amount the investment is worth at time <m>t</m> must satisfy the
      differential equation <m>``\d'' p=.05p\cdot ``\d'' t.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      All of this suggests that <m>p=e^{.05t}</m> satisfies the differential
      equation <m>``d'' p/``d'' t=.05p</m> with initial condition <m>p(0)=1.</m> In
      general, we would have <m>p(t)=e^{rt}</m> satisfying the equations <m>``d'' p/``d''
      t=rp,\ \ p(0)=1.</m>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What would the effective yield be for a bond nominally rated at
          <m>5\%</m> annually compounded continuously? How does this compare to
          the effective yield of an investment compounded daily?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we had two investments growing continually with nominal
          rates of <m>5\%</m> and <m>10\%</m> annually? Would the effective yield of
          the second investment be twice that of the first? Justify your
          answer.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      For <m>r=1,</m> we have the function <m>p(t)=e^t,</m> which is called the
      natural exponential function and it satisfies <m>``d'' e^t /``d'' t=e^t,\
      \ e^0=1.</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      Such a function which grows this way constitutes exponential growth.
      You might have heard the phrase <q>growing exponentially</q> referring to
      something which grows very fast. The following graph of <m>p(t)=e^t</m>
      illustrates this
      <image width="56%" source="images/ExpGraph.png" />
      Indeed, Table compares values of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and <m>p(x) = e^x</m> for
      various values of <m>x.</m>

    <p>
      Not only do continuously compounded investments grow in this manner,
      but exponential growth can be used to model other phenomena (at least
      in the short run). As an example, consider the following situation.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a strain of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. Initially
          there are <m>10</m> mg of the bacteria growing continually at a (nominal)
          hourly rate of 25<percent />. How much bacteria would there be at time <m>t</m>
          hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          {<em>Solution:</em>} Let <m>b=b(t)</m> denote the amount of bacteria (in mg) at time <m>t</m> hours. We have that <m>b</m> satisfies the following differential equation and initial condition
          <me>
            \dfdx{b}{t}=.25b,\ \ b(0)=10.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          This says that <m>b(t)=10e^.25t.</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      The term nominal growth rate, though appropriate for investing money,
      is not typically used in such a biological example. Typically, such
      problems are stated more in this fashion.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a strain of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. Initially
          there is <m>10</m> mg of the bacteria and it is noticed that in <m>3</m> hours,
          the amount has doubled. How much will there be at any time <m>t.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          {<em>Solution:</em>} As before, we let <m>b=b(t)</m>
          represent the amount of bacteria (in mg) at time <m>t</m> hours. Assuming
          that the bacteria grows at a rate proportional to the amount
          present, we have the following
          <me>
            \dfdx{b}{t}=rb\ \ b(0)=10.
          </me>
          where <m>r</m> is some as yet to be determined constant. At this point, we
          know that <m>b=10e^rt,</m> and we need to determine <m>r.</m> To do this, we have
          a different piece of information, namely, <m>b(3)=20.</m> Substituting this
          in, we get
          <me>
            20=b(3)=10b^{3r}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          What we need to do is find the inverse of this exponential function.
          With this in mind, we define the <em>natural logarithm</em> function, denoted
          <m>\ln x,</m> as follows.
          <m>y=\ln x</m> exactly when <m>x=e^y.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Another way of saying this is that <m>\ln x</m> is the exponent so that
          <m>e^{\ln x}=x.</m>
          For example, we have some fairly straightforward observations:
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point it would be useful to compare the graphs of <m>y=e^x</m> and
          <m>y=\ln x.</m> Since they are inverse functions then one graph is the
          reflection of the other about the line <m>y=x.</m>
          <image width="56%" source="images/LogAndExp.png" />
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Before we delve further into the natural logarithm function, let's see
      how it applies to our problem above.
    </p>

    <p>
      We needed to solve the equation <m>20=10e^3r.</m> To do this, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>2\amp =e^3r</mrow>
        <mrow>\ln 2\amp =\ln e^3r =3r</mrow>
        <mrow>r\amp =ln2/3 \approx 2.463</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the amount of bacteria at time t is given by
      <me>
        b\approx 10e^{2.463t}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, as with any mathematical model, this is only an
      approximation of real life. As we noticed, this exponential function
      would grow exponentially, and there is definitely a limit to the
      amount of bacteria that will grow in a Petri dish. At best, this
      model can only be used for relatively small values of <m>t.</m> Later we
      will look at more complicated models for this growth, where we put
      limitations in. But for now, notice that we can play with our
      function mathematically, we can get an equation that might be a bit
      more appealing.
      <me>
        b=10e^{\ln2/3 t}=10\left(e^{\ln 2}\right)^(t/3)=10\cdot2^{t/3}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This general exponential function is a bit more appealing as it
      encapsulates better the idea that the amount doubles every <m>3</m> hours.
      The natural logarithm function is actually the key to a number of
      related properties of general exponential functions. But before we do
      that, let's consider the case of exponential decay. You may have
      heard of utilizing radioactive carbon dating to determine the age of
      various fossils. What does this entail and how is it related to what
      we have been talking about? Radioactive carbon dating was invented by
      Willard Libby in the late <m>1940</m>'s at it became a standard tool for
      archeologists to date their discoveries. Libby received the Nobel
      Prize in Chemistry in <m>1960</m> for his work on this. The idea is based on
      the fact that radiocarbon (<m>C_{14}</m>) is constantly being created in the
      atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric
      nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen
      to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants
      by photosynthesis; animals then acquire <m>C_{14}</m> by eating the plants. When
      the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its
      environment, and from that point onwards the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> it contains
      begins to reduce as the <m>C_{14}</m> undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the
      amount of <m>C_{14}</m> in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as piece of
      wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to
      calculate when the animal or plant died
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating). Exponential decay
      comes from the fact that radioactive materials decay at a rate which
      is proportional to the amount of radioactive material left. This rate
      is measured by the materials half-life. For example, <m>C_{14}</m> has a
      half-life of about <m>5730</m> years. This says that if we have an amount of
      <m>C_{14},</m> then in <m>5730</m> years we would have half of that amount, in another
      <m>5730</m> years we would have half of that (one quarter the original), and
      so on. The following example illustrates how the technique works.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>c=c(t)</m> represent the amount of Carbon-14 in a sample at any time
          <m>t</m> years. If we let <m>c(0)=c_0</m> denote the original amount in the
          sample, then how much is in the sample at any time <m>t.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          {<em>Solution:</em>} We have that <m>c</m> satisfies the
          differential equation <m>\dfdx{c}{t}=rc.</m> This says that <m>c=c_0e^{rt}.</m>
          To determine <m>r,</m> notice that <m>c(5730)=1/2 c_0.</m> This gives us
          <m>1/2c_0=c_0 e^{5730r},</m> <m>r=\ln(1/2)/5730.</m>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus we have
          <me>
            c=c_0 e^{\ln(1/2)/5730 t}=c_0 \left(e^{\ln(1/2)}\right)^{t/5730}=c_0
            (1/2)^{t/5730}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is consistent with the idea that the amount halves every <m>5730</m>
          years. Of course, we can apply this to other situations as well.

    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we have a wooden handle from a tool that contains 80<percent /> of
        the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> that it should contain. How old is the tool?
      </p>

      <p>
        {<em>Solution:</em>} Applying the previous formula, we have
        <me>
          c_0 e^{\ln(1/2)/5730 t}=.8c_0
        </me>
        and we need to find <m>t.</m> Solving we get:
        <md>
          <mrow>e^{\ln(1/2)/5730 t}\amp =.8</mrow>
          <mrow>\ln(1/2)/5730 t\amp =\ln(.8)</mrow>
          <mrow>t\amp =5730\ln(.8)/\ln(.5) \approx 1845 \text{ years }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <problem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How old would the tool be if the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> was 70<percent /> or 90<percent />?
